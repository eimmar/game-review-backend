            "body": "<p>In the three years since <a href=\"/persona-5/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-115534\">Persona 5</a>'s original release, I've thought about it almost <em>every day</em>. Its lavish style gracefully captures its spirit of rebellion and breathes life into its dynamic combat system. The evocative, banging soundtrack perfectly encapsulates the emotion of each moment. The downtime spent in Tokyo with your friends brings you closer to each of them, invigorating your fight for what's right. All those qualities feed into a bold story that unapologetically puts its foot down against the injustices that reflect our own society.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The extended version, <a href=\"/persona-5-royal/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-494659\">Persona 5 Royal</a>, brings the heat all over again. But beyond a plethora of superb gameplay refinements and features that improve an already-rich RPG comes a momentous new story arc seeded within the original narrative and paid off in full by the end. It delivers something genuinely surprising, leading to awe-inspiring moments and emotional conclusions that recontextualize what I thought the game was. Through its <a href=\"/articles/persona-5-royal-how-long-to-beat-plus-to-finish-ne/1100-6475460/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475460\">lengthy 120-hour runtime</a>, Persona 5 Royal proves itself as the definitive version of a modern classic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The minute you start P5R, you're given the fantastic in media res introduction that brilliantly showcases the ride you're in for--and provides a glimpse at the Royal-exclusive character Kasumi. After this teaser, you're brought to the chronological start of the story that then walks you through the events that lit the fire inside our protagonist (aka Joker) and kicked off his journey as a virtuous trickster. The opening hours may take some time to pick the pace back up, but by easing you into the game's systems, you're set up for the rest of its flow.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">P5R expertly intertwines the daily structure of living life as a Japanese high school student and a supernatural-powered vigilante fighting evil in an alternate dimension. Because the social sim elements and RPG dungeon crawling are woven together seamlessly, you grow attached to the very world you're fighting to change. It's a format that's been the series foundation since <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-fes/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-29328\">Persona 3</a>, and it is at its most effective here in P5R with a range of possibilities and new minor UI elements that help communicate your options. Carefully choosing how to spend your precious days and nights by balancing school life, relationships, and your duties as a Phantom Thief throughout the calendar year even makes the mundane exciting.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650465-persona%205%20royal_20200324152944.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650465\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650465-persona%205%20royal_20200324152944.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650465\"><img alt=\"Best girl Makoto is down to throw hands while being a straight-A student.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650465-persona%205%20royal_20200324152944.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650465-persona%205%20royal_20200324152944.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650465-persona%205%20royal_20200324152944.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3650465-persona%205%20royal_20200324152944.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Best girl Makoto is down to throw hands while being a straight-A student.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">You'll spend time with characters to learn about what drives them and witness their growth as they internalize and overcome their traumatic pasts. Among your connections are kindhearted adults exhausted by a system that has failed them and teenagers haunted by their past and dreading their future. These are very human stories that often hit close to home and inspire in their own small way (although some are inherently awkward). And these relationships with your Confidants bestow powers you carry into battle. P5R makes the Confidant process easier with new scenes, in the form of phone calls, to help rank them up faster, effectively granting the opportunity to see more of these enticing stories. It's important because there are a few new Confidants to bond with as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The key new opportunities are with Goro Akechi, who is now someone you choose to spend time with, which eventually leads to a better understanding and development of him this time around. <a href=\"/articles/audio-logs-how-persona-5-royals-new-character-was-/1100-6475614/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475614\">Kasumi Yoshizawa</a> has been touted as the big addition to the roster; she fits in well and you'll see that her desire to be an elite competitive gymnast comes from a darker, complicated place. Although her screen time is limited in the first half of the game, she becomes vital to the delivery of the new story beats and a welcome ally to fight alongside the rest of the gang you know and love. Above all is the school counselor Takuto Maruki, a tremendous character who truly elevates P5R's narrative. He's an excellent thematic fit, offering perspectives on mental health that hadn't been touched in the original. His story is cleverly integrated into the core narrative, and <a href=\"/articles/persona-5-royal-how-to-get-the-new-palace-and-seme/1100-6475412/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475412\">he's also key for unlocking</a> what's beyond Persona 5's original story and some of P5R's best moments.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650620-persona%205%20royal_20200306154638.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650620\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650620-persona%205%20royal_20200306154638.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650620\"><img alt=\"Persona 5 Royal wouldn't be what it is without Dr. Maruki.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650620-persona%205%20royal_20200306154638.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650620-persona%205%20royal_20200306154638.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650620-persona%205%20royal_20200306154638.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3650620-persona%205%20royal_20200306154638.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Persona 5 Royal wouldn't be what it is without Dr. Maruki.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Relationships are what drive you, but the hard-fought battles take place in the Metaverse, a physical manifestation of corrupted cognition. Demonic shadows lurk as you work to metaphysically crush the distorted desires of abusers who have oppressed your friends and many others--and you do so with a hyper-stylized, confident swagger. With most Palaces comes a new party member and story thread about what led them to join the cause. These aren't solely tragic backstories for the sake of being dramatic, though--it's how you come to understand their fighting spirit before they become a beloved comrade. Taking on these story-critical Palaces never loses its luster, as their trippy, imaginative designs and enemies allure you into the wild battles throughout. At times, the very premise of Palaces is subverted to great effect; sometimes evildoers aren't the only ones who need a change of heart. It further compels you to seek what lies ahead.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond a plethora of superb gameplay refinements and features that improve an already-rich RPG comes a momentous new story arc seeded within the original narrative and paid off in full by the end.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">Palaces feature some small but smart changes in P5R, too. Rearranged dungeon layouts accommodate Joker's new grappling hook, letting you swing to new areas. They often lead to Will Seeds, a collectible that replenishes SP and mold into useful accessories. Returning players may also notice that some dungeon layouts have been streamlined, making exploration smoother. Mementos, the Metaverse's collection of procedurally generated floors, also gets some much-needed overhauls. Driving around to progress in these twisted subway depths as the Morgana bus was novel, but grew repetitive in the original game. P5R throws in new mechanics like collecting flowers and stamps to cash in for useful items and perks to boost battle rewards. And the most welcome change is that, instead of the same song throughout, new tunes play at deeper levels.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650534-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-12h23m21s072.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650534\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650534-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-12h23m21s072.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650534\"><img alt=\"Joker and Kasumi be like v O_O.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650534-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-12h23m21s072.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650534-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-12h23m21s072.png 1920w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650534-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-12h23m21s072.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3650534-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-12h23m21s072.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Joker and Kasumi be like v O_O.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Aside from stealthily navigating these surreal dungeons, you'll be spending a ton of time engaged in P5R's dynamic turn-based combat. It's swift and stylish, and builds on the strong foundation of <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-nocturne/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-14816\">Shin Megami Tensei</a>, which has you focusing on exploiting elemental weaknesses and earning extra turns. Standard enemies can be fodder once their affinities are exposed, but tougher ones, minibosses, and bosses tap into combat's intricacies. P5R layers more onto battles, like the absurd Showtime attacks that have two party members partner up for a high-damage combo that initiates in clutch situations. The powered-up Baton Pass mechanic is even more crucial as it can boost damage and replenish HP and SP. And boss fights now have different phases that present new, tough challenges that require you to think more tactically, testing your mastery of the combat system.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The dripping swagger of it all extends to the snappy and efficient UI that helps keep up combat's fast pace. Everything unfolds in such a quick and ridiculously stylish fashion that you can't help but fall in love with it and the Phantom Thieves who pull off all these flashy moves. Even in a second version of the game, executing all-out attacks and watching them unfold hasn't lost one bit of its charm. Never has a turn-based combat system been this thrilling.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Persona 5 Royal is many things: a collection of small inspiring stories, an ambitious harrowing journey with some good friends, a stunning visual and auditory experience, a resounding call to action.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">But P5R isn't here to just look pretty. Beneath the mask of its unrelenting style and charming silliness are the friendships you naturally form and motivate you to follow the fight through to the very end. From their persona awakenings to the moment you see them fully realize their goals, your fellow Phantom Thieves become your ride or die in this heavy-hitting story. In targeting perpetrators of sexual assault, worker exploitation, and vile authoritarianism, Persona 5 draws a clear line in the sand--people like this have no place in our society and deserve no mercy. There is no middle ground, no compromise to be made, no both sides-ism. Your crew's personal drama sometimes seeps into the broader message, but not without illustrating why you're fighting so hard to change things. Even when doubt about their vigilante ways starts to creep in, characters work through it, stick to their ideals, and realize there wasn't really a choice in the matter.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650547-persona%205%20royal_20200322020607.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650547\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650547-persona%205%20royal_20200322020607.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650547\"><img alt=\"Morgana said eat the rich.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650547-persona%205%20royal_20200322020607.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650547-persona%205%20royal_20200322020607.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650547-persona%205%20royal_20200322020607.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3650547-persona%205%20royal_20200322020607.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Morgana said eat the rich.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Admittedly, P5R is often subtle as a brick. It's easy to nitpick where its writing falls into being too simplistic or a bit rote--although it has improved in some ways, it can still be crude at times. It isn't particularly nuanced in its storytelling, but it doesn't have to be. In being clear as day in its narrative, the messages and characterizations are unmistakable. It's also so wild to me that the game's almost-caricature villains have become less and less far-fetched in just the three years since the original release--the blatant abuse of power, their wrongdoings laid bare, and the masses uninterested in seeing them face consequences. The conclusion to the original narrative arc just hits differently now, and the game's dramatic battles have become increasingly cathartic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Transitioning into the Royal-exclusive third semester, there's a tonal shift that's effortlessly executed. Stranger things begin to happen, in an oddly unsettling way, especially during the seemingly blissful winter. Here, P5R takes a turn toward genuine moral quandaries. In this third semester, there's a bit more to learn about your friends, and there's one final Palace to infiltrate. And it is, without a doubt, the best one in the entire game.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\">These new events are beautifully captured with new Royal-exclusive songs that amplify what was already an iconic, genre-bending soundtrack.</p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650619-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-14h17m48s065.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650619\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650619-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-14h17m48s065.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650619\"><img alt=\"Kasumi fits right in fighting alongside the Phantom Thieves.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650619-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-14h17m48s065.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650619-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-14h17m48s065.png 1920w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650619-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-14h17m48s065.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3650619-vlcsnap-2020-04-03-14h17m48s065.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Kasumi fits right in fighting alongside the Phantom Thieves.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The mysteries within will surprise you, and fascinating revelations about characters propel them well beyond who they presented themselves to be. The pace at which it's told and how the series of events are framed paint Persona 5 in a new, captivating light while staying true to its original spirit. This new story arc achieves a grand sense of scale and finality, yet captures a more intimate, personal tone. And it all builds up to what's also the greatest boss battle in all of the game, pushing your combat abilities to their limits.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">P5R effectively solves one of the original's shortcomings: its somewhat abrupt end. In the vanilla version, even after over 100 hours, it felt like there was still a missing piece; P5R has that missing piece. There's 15 to 20 hours worth of excellent content that takes Persona 5 in a different direction while going all-in on its best qualities. It gives a dramatic, stunning finish even after the original's bombastic, over-the-top conclusion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These new events are beautifully captured with new Royal-exclusive songs that amplify what was already an iconic, genre-bending soundtrack. I always recognized \"Life Will Change\" and \"Rivers In The Desert\" as perfect examples of how Persona 5 uses its music to portray precise emotions of the moment--songs that exudes the infectious confidence of the Phantom Thieves going in to take a corrupted heart. As the case with our old favorites, the new evocative jams become a powerful narrative device. \"I Believe\" stands a bold recollection of the long, hard-fought journey that culminates to one last battle, while \"Throw Away Your Mask\" carries the hint of reluctance between a clash of ideals. The new Palace's theme has a wistfulness that permeates the scenarios that unfold. Music is inseparable from the Persona experience--the series thrives because of it--and somehow, some way P5R delivers again to make an even stronger impact.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650572-persona%205%20royal_20200327005727.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650572\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650572-persona%205%20royal_20200327005727.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650572\"><img alt=\"The downtime gives you the opportunity to reflect and just chill with your crew.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650572-persona%205%20royal_20200327005727.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3650572-persona%205%20royal_20200327005727.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3650572-persona%205%20royal_20200327005727.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3650572-persona%205%20royal_20200327005727.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>The downtime gives you the opportunity to reflect and just chill with your crew.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">So, just like in the original, the song \"Sunset Bridge\" brought my time with P5R to a close. It's a bittersweet tune that's used throughout the game to signify a moment of clarity for its characters. But as the final background track before having to leave the game behind, it became my own personal moment of clarity, realizing just how much I've cherished my time here, and now for all-new reasons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As P5R comes to a close, it tries to ease you into its end with heartfelt scenes, some new and some familiar. But in doing so, it only makes it harder to say goodbye again. Persona 5 Royal is many things: a collection of small inspiring stories, an ambitious harrowing journey with some good friends, a stunning visual and auditory experience, a resounding call to action. By refining what was already great and building on its best qualities with a brilliant new story arc, Persona 5 Royal asserts itself as an unforgettable and empowering RPG that should be recognized as one of the best games of our time.</p>",

Even simple tasks like delivering parcels or mopping up the floor are made comically complicated with unpredictable physics and ridiculous office tools at your disposal. Good Job isn't so much about finding a way to achieve your objectives in the cleanest manner possible, but is instead a fun playground for you and some friends to muck about in. It's at its best when it gives you the freedom to create solutions to puzzles using the chaos you orchestrate, only faltering in a handful of scenarios.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Good Job puts you in the working boots of the ill-equipped and woefully unqualified child of a mega-corporation's CEO, and you're given any and every job possible as you climb the corporate ladder. The first floors are simple--you mop up brightly colored goop off the floor, deliver packages to color-coded desks, and courier projectors to meeting rooms in need. As trivial as it sounds, the chaotic layout of the offices combined with the loose, QWOP-like control scheme makes moving objects feel like you're spring cleaning after a rough night out at a bar. Dragging a projector, for example, is humorously tricky. It easily slides around while you drag it, knocking over decorative art pieces and smashing the glass walls of meeting rooms. Good Job isn't worried about how well you complete a job, but rather if you're able to get it done period. Leaving a mess of memos, fire extinguisher foam, and distressed co-workers in your wake just makes it more fun.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

physically reactive, giving every little bump the potential to set off a chain reaction of destruction. Each level is designed with this in mind, forcing you to navigate through doors just too small to pull objects through, around twisting hallways filled with precariously placed vases and paintings, and over electrical cables that will catch anything you might be dragging with you. These are presented not only as obstacles, but as fun opportunities to create chaos that makes your job a little easier.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Electrical cables, for example, can be used as slingshots for office chairs or useless photocopiers, letting you smash through walls to create shorter routes or large doorways. You can reroute cables to move other employees impeding your progress too, disconnecting the distracting television they are fixated on and forcing them to get back to work. Motorized floor cleaners will handle a spill in a flash but can also act as a barely-controllable vehicle that displaces nearly everything in front of it. Most of Good Job's office tools and equipment function as you expect them to, but have the flexibility for you to turn them into ridiculous means of completing your objectives.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These objectives change with each level, tying into the themes of each of the nine different floors. These rapidly change from predictable corporate workspaces to colorful biomes filled with small ponds and overflowing vegetation and pristine labs housing automated robots and a variety of chemistry equipment. Each floor's theme is a welcome change, and the handful of levels within each are briskly-paced and avoid outstaying their welcome. There are a few levels that are much larger in size than the rest, which makes navigating them at your walking pace a bit of a chore. Without direct camera control it's also more challenging to survey these larger levels as opposed to the more self-contained ones, making them far less fun to play through.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each floor also introduces new mechanics, and Good Job continually combines them with new types of objectives and clever spins on repeating ones. The process of mopping up a mess is expanded upon in a later level, where you navigate a lab with an expanding, gelatinous pink cube that soaks up any moisture around it as it grows. It's functionally the same mechanic--you're moving around a space and cleaning up a liquid mess--but the means of doing so change enough to make it feel new. Watching the cube morph its shape to narrow doorways created by overhead pipes gives the objective its own unique feel, making it stand out rather than blend in with similar stages.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is one of many examples, with Good Job mixing together its various office contraptions to allow you to create your own solutions to puzzles. There are obvious ways to achieve your goals, and there weren't any puzzles that left me pondering a solution for more than a moment. Figuring out how to complete a level in a different manner was consistently satisfying, however, thanks to the unpredictable reactions you need to discover to achieve a solution. It's rewarding to stumble upon actions that you might not have considered--in my case, how an overloaded vacuum cleaner could be used as a mobile explosive to destroy restrictive level layouts--which lead to pockets of joyful discovery. You can play Good Job both solo or with friends in cooperative play, and its malleable puzzle solutions allowed me to comfortably complete each one regardless of how many other people I was playing with.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

get too complex with its puzzles for its style of gameplay to support. Some solutions require a degree of precision that is both frustrating and unsatisfying to match. In one instance I had to roll three large boulders over to a zen garden, placing each in a specific hole. Rolling them in a particular direction was challenging enough, but having them move off their marked spot with just the slightest touch made it infuriating to line up five in close proximity to each other. In another stage I was tasked with cleaning up a lab floor completely, forcing me to hunt for small paint pixels across a floor strewn with knocked-over objects and destructive collateral. In both cases, Good Job abandons the freedom it encourages in finding solutions to its puzzles, and loses most of its enjoyment in the process.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These moments are fleeting and not frequent enough to put you off the majority of Good Job's charming and engaging puzzles. It finds a middle ground between being a destructive playground and an inventive puzzler, with enough variety throughout to make its brief playtime feel well-balanced. You certainly aren't the best person for any of the jobs you're thrust into, but it's a lot of the fun bumbling your way through it all anyway and still getting the job done at the end of the day.</p>",

            "body": "<p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are many reasons why you could be scared to get in a rideshare. You're putting your trust in a stranger who knows more about you than you know about them, and you have no control over the vehicle where you are both confined. But what if, on top of having a driver making increasingly uncomfortable conversation, they take an unexpected turn, before the car mysteriously breaks down in the middle of a dark road in the woods that look straight out of The Blair Witch Project? That's the premise of the new horror film, The Toll, which was set to make its world premiere at the SXSW film festival, and is a minimalistic yet effective horror tale which sadly strays too far from its promising start.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The main character is Cami (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/jordan-hayes\">Jordan Hayes</a>), who we meet after she exits the airport and gets in a rideshare on her way to visit her divorced father. It may be that she's tired from her flight, or it may be that her driver Spencer (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/max-topplin\">Max Topplin</a>) is a bit too inquisitive and has a thing for inappropriate jokes that could be interpreted as threatening, but the longer the ride goes, the more uncomfortable and alert she grows. The entire first act of the film is just Hayes and Topplin in a claustrophobic car ride, and it is a credit to the film's writing and the performances of both actors that the audience doesn't really know what to think of Spencer. Yes, he seems a bit weird, but he admits to being socially awkward and bad with people, which makes him a bit endearing, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Topplin easily makes his character sympathetic with seemingly genuine attempts at trying to make small-talk and has enough excuses to make us believe he does care for the safety and comfort of his passenger. Credit should go to Hayes' performance, which balances sympathy while making you want to stay at arm's length. You fully understand why Cami takes out her pepper spray, as the film's editing intercuts closeup shots of Spencer and Cami with shots of the claustrophobic vehicle completely isolated on the empty road to increase tension.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Spencer takes an unfamiliar turn, the car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and The Toll shifts tonal gears to enter the supernatural, as the entity known as The Toll Man starts messing with the two unfortunate souls trapped in his path. Writer/director Michael Nader makes his feature debut with a film that's all about paranoia, whether it’s about being paranoid of the other person in the car, or supernatural creatures lurking in the shadows. Once the creepy messages telling of The Toll Man start showing up out of nowhere, Spencer suddenly stops seeming like a serial killer, and the uncomfortable rideshare turns into a fight for survival.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Toll is all about simplicity, and Nader knows how to use the tools at his disposal for all they're worth. Eerie atmospheric music by Torin Borrowdale creates tension even when the characters think they’re safe, and cinematographer Jordan Kennington ups the creepy imagery ante by making the small stretch of road look like a massive labyrinthine forest full of danger. Though there's not much in terms of flashy effects or even characters, the film makes it work by always staying close to Cami and Spencer in their little corner of hell even as what looks like creepy mannequins with smiley faces start showing up to signal the arrival of the Toll Man. Nader wears his influences on his sleeve, from a creature that both resembles Slenderman and has a background that could fit the creepypasta figure, to the characters literally taking the time to discuss the 2008 film The Strangers as if it were a decades-old horror classic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though The Toll starts out promising and creepy, once the story takes a supernatural turn, Nader also explores the backstories for the characters, in what seems like an attempt to make the film a story of gaslighting and rape victims not being believed. The problem is that Nader has neither the necessary tact nor the ability to effectively weave these themes with the horror of the plot as the film wants you to believe. Instead, this subplot feels like low-hanging fruit that instantly becomes an afterthought, a lazy attempt to justify the paranoia and mistrust between the characters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Toll works best when it is simply about the fears of being in a car with someone you don't know, and how every little thing becomes a cause for suspicions. When stripped bare, Nader's debut is an effective horror debut, but when the film tries to shift tonal gears, it becomes a little too busy.</p>",

A remake of the original 1999 game, Resident Evil 3 puts the volatile and intense conflict between protagonist Jill Valentine and the unrelenting force of nature, Nemesis, front and center--giving way to some strong survival horror moments that show off the best of what the series can offer. But after that solid start, this revisit to a bygone era not only loses track of the type of horror game that Resident Evil once was, but also loses sight of what made the original so memorable.</span></p><p>Much like 2019's <a href=\"/resident-evil-2/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-448874\">Resident Evil 2</a>, the remake of Resident Evil 3 interprets the classic survival horror game through a modern lens, redesigning locations and altering key events to fit a significantly revised story. Resident Evil 3 doesn't deviate too much from the formula set by the RE2 remake, but it does lean harder into the action-focused slant the original version of RE3 had, giving you some greater defensive skills to survive. RE3's introduction is a strong one, conveying a creeping sense of paranoia and dread that's synonymous with the series, and Jill Valentine once again proves herself to be a confident protagonist to take everything head-on.</p><p>RE3 is very much a companion piece to the previous game, serving as a simultaneous prequel and sequel that caps off the saga in Raccoon City. There are even key points in the story that expect you to know of prior characters or locations that tie back to the previous remake. While you won't miss out on anything vital for not having played RE2, some of the previous game's most poignant moments are given more subtext in RE3. You'll eventually cross paths with supporting characters like mercenary Carlos Oliveira, the game's second playable character, along with some other unsavory individuals looking to take advantage of the chaos.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1579/15792183/3647664-main%201.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647664\"

throughout the incident, which ensures that the game isn't always so serious. Both protagonists are also given some key moments throughout the story that show off their skills and personality more, which is fun and satisfying to see play out. But disappointingly, RE3's story reaches its conclusion after a brisk six-hour campaign, which is made worse by a lackluster finish that left me wanting. While this is comparable to the original game, the shrinking scope of the remake's plot and locations makes its short run even more apparent.</p><p>Throughout the game, Jill Valentine is a capable survivor, more so than both Leon and Claire, and she's well-suited to handle the undead and other bioweapon monstrosities like the Nemesis that roam the city. Along with dodging attacks, she can also execute slow-mo evasive rolls that open a clean shot at the enemy's weak point, which can be especially satisfying to pull off during an intense encounter.</p><p>There's a more pronounced emphasis on action and quick reflexes in RE3, which can make the shooting, survival, and exploration loop a bit more engaging and responsive. While this ultimately gives you a greater feeling of control in the field, it's not enough to the point that it makes encounters with the ravenous undead or Nemesis easy. So while you are capable, it's often best to play it safe. Resident Evil 3 tries to stick with the tenets of survival horror gameplay and is generally far more challenging than RE2, due to its greater focus on inventory management and ammo crafting. However, the generous save points and checkpoints ensure you won't suffer too steep a loss after death.</p><p>Resident Evil 3 also carries forth many of the successes from the Resident Evil 2 remake, which gives it a leg up for its own outing. As with previous games, RE3 is all about escalation, forcing you to contend with dwindling resources as the monsters--and Nemesis--put the pressure on. Unlike in Resident Evil 2, which quickly took you off the streets of Raccoon City, you spend more time in RE3 exploring the main roads, side alleys, and other points of interest in town.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6452581\" data-src=\"/videos/resident-evil-3-remake-terrifying-nemesis-chase-ga/2300-6452581/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe   src=\"/videos/embed/6452581/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p>RE3 possesses an impeccable level of detail for the locations and action during its six-hour campaign, right down to the tense atmosphere and grisly violence. The brutality and devastation in Raccoon City is demonstrated effectively thanks to the vivid and grotesque details as you explore the ruined city. The game also draws your eyes to the many locales that reference classic Resident Evil, which is not only fun to see, but manages to tug on the nostalgic heartstrings.</p><p>One of my favorite areas of RE3 is Downtown Raccoon City, which shows off the best that the remake has to offer. As an expansive map, it not only has diverse locations, and plenty of undead, it also displays the dynamic nature of the game's true star--Nemesis. The imposing villain quickly establishes himself as a cunning force when encountered out in the open.</p><p>The Nemesis has many tricks up its sleeve, such as using its tentacles to trip you up or turning other zombies into horrific mutations, all of which are disturbing to witness. It'll actively stalk and follow you into places you once thought were safe--bending the unspoken rules of engagement in survival horror to establish its presence further. Nemesis makes Mr. X from RE2 come across as a fedora-wearing goon, and even when you find yourself in a safe space, you can catch a glimpse of the villain waiting outside for you to leave--which stand as some of the most unnerving moments of the game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1579/15792183/3647702-brad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647702\" data-ratio=\"0.56171875\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1579/15792183/3647702-brad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647702\"><img alt=\"Other characters from Resident Evil's past are given a new look in this remake.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1579/15792183/3647702-brad.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1579/15792183/3647702-brad.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1579/15792183/3647702-brad.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Other characters from Resident Evil's past are given a new look in this remake.</figcaption></figure><p>However, as the game goes on, it becomes clear that Resident Evil 3 struggles to maintain its poise when the scope begins to narrow, and how blatantly the game relies on recycling many of RE2's tricks and tropes, which now feel less interesting. This has to do with the game's focus on momentum. Just when you're getting accustomed to a location, particularly the extensive and varied Downtown area, a story beat will occur that brings you to the next area, preventing your return. The series' penchant for puzzles are also infrequent in RE3 remake, putting more focus on exploration and combat which can eventually become exhausting.</p><p>It can be tricky to balance the elements of both survival horror and action gameplay, as one can easily undermine the other, and unfortunately, this is apparent in RE3. There are many moments where the game's strengths for action <em>and</em> horror shine, particularly during the more open areas where the Nemesis is afoot. Generally, though--especially toward the second half--its attempts to balance both can come across as awkward and uninteresting, and at its worst, they can be jarring. This is especially true with the many elaborate set-piece encounters, where you control Jill as she navigates Uncharted-esque sequences that are highly-scripted gameplay moments that go for the cinematic effect. They often result in tonal whiplash, as you typically transition back into the slower, survival-horror pacing right after.</p><p>This is most evident in the portrayal of the game's primary antagonist. Nemesis is at its best when stalking you in the streets. But these sections--while terrifyingly engaging--are fleeting. Nemesis only actively hunts you during the opening section in Downtown Raccoon City. The majority of the Nemesis encounters occur in scripted sequences that lead up to boss fights. In the original game, Nemesis' random appearances kept you on edge. In contrast, the remake's use of Nemesis in the mid-to-late game will likely have you roll your eyes at the prospect of another lengthy and fixed encounter.</p><blockquote><p>However, as the game goes on, it becomes clear that Resident Evil 3 struggles to maintain its poise when the scope begins to narrow...</p></blockquote><p>Nemesis is undoubtedly one of the most iconic villains of the series, and it's frustrating and disappointing to see it effectively sidelined, coming off more like a standard Resident Evil boss that springs out at story beats. Another side effect of the lack of Nemesis encounters in the game is that it calls attention to the lack of enemy diversity. While the series' regular zombies are in plentiful supply, most other enemy types don't show up as often, which makes combat and survival elements feel stale towards the end.</p><p>In keeping with previous games, finishing RE3 opens up some additional features when you complete it, which come in the form of a shop in the main menu that lets you purchase new costumes, weapons, and other items. This allows you to essentially customize your next playthrough, giving you certain key items earlier than intended or increasing your attack power and defensive capabilities. While these changes can be fun for a revisit, there isn't much else in the way of bonus content to keep you going, aside from a new playthrough in the game's nightmare difficulty mode that ratchets up the pressure even more.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6452591\" data-src=\"/videos/resident-evil-3-remake-multiplayer-gameplay-beta/2300-6452591/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe   src=\"/videos/embed/6452591/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Also included with the remake is Resident Evil: Resistance, an asymmetrical online mode pitting four survivors against a lone player in the role of the overseeing antagonist. In essence, it's a more accessible take on the franchise's previous experiment with online horror, Resident Evil Outbreak, with some echoes of other asymmetrical games like Dead by Daylight or Left 4 Dead. Four players use their different skills to fight off monsters and complete objectives to make it to the stage's exit. All the while, one enemy player will observe the action through security cameras to lay traps, summon monsters, and manipulate the environment to spell a quick end to the group's escape.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Playing as the survivors feels closer to traditional Resident Evil, where resources are scarce and the stakes become increasingly more significant. Using each survivor's skills effectively can come in clutch during a tough fight, saving you and your team from the mastermind's tactics. As you invest time in playing as the various characters, you'll increase in rank and unlock different skills and cosmetics for them. By completing daily and weekly challenges, along with completing matches, you'll acquire RP that's spent on loot boxes that yield bonus items for the group of survivors and the set of playable masterminds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Resistance has interesting ideas when it comes to bringing the series' survival horror gameplay online, and it does an adequate job of getting you up to speed with solid tutorials. Yet the overall execution of the game's mechanics often comes off as clunky and undercooked. During peak moments of action, the controls for the survivors feel unresponsive, especially when trying to get a clean hit on fast-moving targets. Resistance lacks a personality of its own, clinging tightly to references and Easter eggs to other entries in the series. While each survivor has a backstory, they mostly pull on horror movie cliches and archetypes, and they rarely speak during the actual game, which can make it hard to connect with them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The most fun to be had in Resistance is playing as the mastermind, where you can see the survival horror gameplay play out from the other side. Some of the most satisfying moments come from whittling down the defenses of the survivors and snatching away their last vestiges of hope as they attempt their final escape. At its best it's a clever real-time strategy twist on the survival horror formula, but generally, the game's already clunky gameplay gets in the way.</p><figure data-align=\"center\"

two, it's still disappointing. Looking back on my first playthrough of the RE3 remake, it was clear that the game reached its peak early and slowly lost momentum going forward. With the remake's shortcomings in mind, it's easy to make comparisons to the original game's approach. In addition to featuring a more dynamic and present Nemesis, Jill's odyssey had more locations to visit. It is impressive to see classic locations like Downtown and Hospital recreated, yet some other places from the original, like the Clock Tower and Park, are absent. While this won't mean much for newcomers, and the remake skirts this by setting up elaborate Nemesis encounters, the shrinking scale of the game diminishes the impact of its plot and events. It's clear that this remake of Resident Evil 3 is missing some crucial beats that could have offered a more effective and satisfying story.</p><p>As a remake, Resident Evil 3 not only falls short of honoring its source, but it also doesn't quite stick the landing as a standalone horror experience. Even without taking into account the original game, or its predecessor, RE3 struggles to keep up with its pace amid a clashing of elements from survival horror and standard action. While it has a strong start and gives its principal villain some great moments, this truncated retelling of the concluding game from the original Resident Evil trilogy doesn't do it proper justice.</p>",

The show is a big, fan-servicey return to the story of legendary Starfleet captain <a href=\"https://www.tvguide.com/news/star-trek-picard-primer-where-we-left-off-with-jean-luc/\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jean-Luc Picard</a> (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/patrick-stewart\">Patrick Stewart</a>), complete with visits from a few beloved characters along the way, and no end of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/star-trek-picard-episode-10-13-easter-eggs-and-ref/2900-3432/\" data-ref-id=\"2900-3432\">Easter eggs and references</a> that often feel like high-fives to the dedicated viewers who've been enjoying the sci-fi franchise for decades, especially in the mid-1990s. Throughout its first season, it often works to update those series, reimagining some of their best ideas through the frame of the modern world. Though it can get bogged down in its attention to Treks of the past, Picard is a darker look at a future that challenges the franchise, not by just telling the stories of great people doing great things--but by amplifying their flaws and forcing them to choose to be better.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Picard picks up the story of Jean-Luc 15 years after he's suffered a major failure: He attempted to lead Starfleet in an enormous rescue to save the endangered Romulans, the Federation's oldest enemies. An immense tragedy, the destruction of the Starfleet's rescue fleet, led to the Federation abandoning the plans to save the Romulans and Picard's resignation in protest. More than a decade later, the series finds him languishing in his French vineyard, while Earth's branch of the Federation has become isolationist and bigoted. Hardship and injustice have festered, especially against synthetic lifeforms, the apparent perpetrators of the tragedy--and Jean-Luc has done little in the intervening years to stop it. That's a stark contrast to the unwaveringly principled captain seen in The Next Generation, which makes it a perfect starting point for Star Trek: Picard.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Picard is shaken out of his complacency with the arrival of Dahj (Isa Briones), a young woman being hunted by Romulan assassins, on Picard's doorstep. Dahj turns out to be a synthetic created in violation of the ban from the remnants of Data (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/brent-spiner\">Brent Spiner</a>), Picard's former android crewmember and old friend, who died to save Picard's life. Stirred by his loyalty and friendship for Data, Picard takes it upon himself to protect Dahj and her sister, Soji, gathering a ragtag crew and taking to the captain's chair one last time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The season is slow to start, especially as it gets bogged down in setting up a world that's something like 30 years ahead of where The Next Generation left off. After the first three episodes, though, Picard hits its stride as it fuses two Star Trek identities: the more action-packed, adventure-focused takes of more recent Trek movies, and the moralistic, cerebral approach of The Next Generation. It's a hybrid that mostly works, too, with Picard occasionally interspersing fun, well-produced action and fight scenes with the moral quandaries and diplomatic conundrums of the Enterprise's voyages. In a lot of ways, slick CGI space battles and choreographed hand-to-hand fights between Romulan agents and super-fast androids make Picard a more modern take on the franchise. With the budget and the effects technology, some of The Next Generation might have looked a little more like Picard.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647024-picard%20episode%2010%203.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647024\" data-ratio=\"0.667\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647024-picard%20episode%2010%203.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647024\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647024-picard%20episode%2010%203.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647024-picard%20episode%2010%203.jpg 1000w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1581/15811374/3647024-picard%20episode%2010%203.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-width=\"1000\"></a></figure><figure data-embed-type=\"gallery\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647026-picard%20ep%2010%204.jpg,https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647027-picard%20ep%2010%205.jpg,https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647028-picard%20ep%2010%206.jpg,https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647029-picard%20episode%2010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647026,1300-3647027,1300-3647028,1300-3647029\" data-resize-urls=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647026-picard%20ep%2010%204.jpg,https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647027-picard%20ep%2010%205.jpg,https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647028-picard%20ep%2010%206.jpg,https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647029-picard%20episode%2010.jpg\"><a href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647026-picard%20ep%2010%204.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647026\"><img src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647026-picard%20ep%2010%204.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image 1\" data-full-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647026-picard%20ep%2010%204.jpg 1200w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1581/15811374/3647026-picard%20ep%2010%204.jpg 480w\"></a><a href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647027-picard%20ep%2010%205.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647027\"><img src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647027-picard%20ep%2010%205.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image 2\" data-full-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647027-picard%20ep%2010%205.jpg 1200w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1581/15811374/3647027-picard%20ep%2010%205.jpg 480w\"></a><a href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647028-picard%20ep%2010%206.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647028\"><img src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647028-picard%20ep%2010%206.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image 3\" data-full-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647028-picard%20ep%2010%206.jpg 1200w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1581/15811374/3647028-picard%20ep%2010%206.jpg 480w\"></a><a href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647029-picard%20episode%2010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3647029\"><img src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/3647029-picard%20episode%2010.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image 4\" data-full-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3647029-picard%20episode%2010.jpg 1200w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1581/15811374/3647029-picard%20episode%2010.jpg 480w\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The darker, more modern take on Star Trek also makes Picard feel more relevant to the world in which we're watching it. The show focuses on the plights of refugees, including the Romulan survivors who were scattered across the galaxy after the failed rescue, and the XBs, victims assimilated by the deadly cybernetic Borg who have been freed from enslavement to its Collective, but who are still mistrusted and exploited. The Starfleet of the future is more insular, abandoning much of its focus on exploration of the galaxy and understanding other life and cultures. It's a Star Trek that uses the lens of science fiction to explore the plights and issues of a more reactionary world than the one in which The Next Generation was made.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But much of Picard's power comes from its dedication to the past. Few opportunities slip past for references to The Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine, or the Star Trek movies. It's not all just about appeasing Trekkers, though--Picard has a deep, encyclopedic knowledge of everything that's happened to its characters over the years, and does a brilliant job of rejoining their stories, exploring their traumas, and advancing their characters in ways that feel true to them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The new additions to Picard, however, function less well. Where returning characters like Jean-Luc and Voyager's Seven of Nine (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/jeri-ryan\">Jeri Ryan</a>) get the benefit of the show building on their lengthy histories, the new ragtag crew often don't really have enough to do, even as the show spends a little time rounding out their backstories. Jean-Luc's often-drunk former first officer, Raffi (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/michelle-hurd\">Michelle Hurd</a>), exists to tap away on holographic computers; what interesting conflict she has with Jean-Luc, based on him abandoning her after the Romulan rescue along with everything else, evaporates not long into the season. The same is true for cyberneticist Agnes Jurati (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/alison-pill\">Alison Pill</a>), who struggles with her role in the creation of Dahj, Soji, and the other synthetics, but who gets back to normal for plot reasons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rios (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/santiago-cabrera\">Santiago Cabrera</a>), the hardnosed captain of the ship Picard hires, is mostly just angry and stoic, and the childishly idealistic, sword-wielding warrior Elnor (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/evan-evagora\">Evan Evagora</a>) seems to primarily exist for fight scenes and innocently misunderstanding situations for laughs.

As mentioned, those looks to the past are strong if you're an established Trek fan, but they often hobble the show's present. Much of what goes on Season 1 of Picard feels like it's setup for a more fleshed-out Season 2.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Still, there's a lot Picard does right. Its update on the Star Trek formula is a sorely needed catch-up to the modern world that makes it feel like Trek has something important to say, and its signature optimism is a perfect fit for the times. It's also keenly aware of everything that made Jean-Luc Picard such a resonant character, and it revisits those aspects without retreading old ground. On the whole, Star Trek: Picard does well to bring Treks of the past forward, and for fans of Jean-Luc and The Next Generation, it's a powerful and emotional revisit to beloved characters.</p><p><em>Disclosure: ViacomCBS is GameSpot's parent company.</em></p>",

            "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It feels like zombies have become scarier over time, especially since, through the decades, the idea of the undead rising to attack the living has evolved from people literally rising from the grave, to a highly contagious virus infecting people and turning them into mindless monsters. When it comes to TV, there's no better show that combines the gore and thrills of a zombie movie with the political plotting and intrigue of Game of Thrones than Netflix's Kingdom, which just returned with a second season.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Picking up right where we left off last season, Kingdom Season 2 throws us into the middle of an epic battle as the Crown Prince of the Joseon Kingdom, Lee Chang (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/ji-hun-ju\">Ji-Hoon Ju</a>), his chief guard Muyeong (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/sang-ho-kim\">Sang-ho Kim</a>), physician Seo-bi (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/doona-bae\">Doona Bae</a>), Chang's former mentor Lord Ahn Hyeon (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/jun-ho-heo\">Jun-ho Heo</a>), and vengeful tiger hunter Yeong-shin (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/sung-kyu-kim\">Kim Sung-kyu</a>) find themselves facing down a zombie horde right outside the Sangju Citadel. And while the disease threatens to ravage the land, those with political power only try to keep themselves safe while shutting out those who actually need help, leaving them to suffer. (Of course, any parallels to reality are merely coincidental.)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In many ways, Kingdom resembles HBO's Game of Thrones, both thematically and structurally. Kingdom spent its 6-episode first season cutting back and forth between the Crown Prince fighting to take back his throne and unravel the horrible things the Haewon Cho clan have done, and Seo-bi slowly discovering the truth behind the zombie outbreak. A big part of the series that carries over to Season 2 is the idea that corruption and official incompetence can lead to catastrophe. In the first season we saw how officials and ministers allowed the disease to spread because they focused on saving themselves rather than helping everyone, and Season 2 pulls back the curtain to show how there are always those who profit off tragedy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">From the grand-scale fight scene that opens the first episode, Kingdom kicks into high gear in its sophomore season. Stories that were merely hinted at in the first 6 episodes suddenly become integral to the plot and get proper time to breathe, while the tiniest of details from Season 1 return in huge ways. Not to be outdone by Game of Thrones, Kingdom also serves as an intriguing courtroom thriller, with a plot involving a mole, and the queen faking a pregnancy while hoping a peasant woman would give birth to a son that she could present as her rightful heir to the throne. Much like early seasons of the HBO show, Kingdom manages to give compelling backstories and motivations to its expanding cast, making even the villains at least a bit sympathetic, all while finding the right balance between action and politics.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of Kingdom's main strengths is its setting. From its lavish costume design, to grand palaces and vistas to the elaborate choreography, this season becomes a feast for the eyes, with cinematography that is just begging to be added to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnePerfectShot\">One Perfect Shot Twitter account</a>. As for the action, this season doubles-down on its Peter Jackson influence, with several of the epic-scale action sequences including direct nods to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The production value seems to have increased this season, as we see more sieges and battles that take place inside grand palaces and walled citadels, with endless hordes trying to break in and just a handful of soldiers with torches shining in the pitch darkness, while the blasting of the cannons fills your ears.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The season finale in particular puts Game of Thrones' \"The Long Night\" to shame, making you feel like you're on the battlefield and the characters are actually in danger. Indeed, no one is safe in this season, and main characters die left and right in the span of minutes, building up to a visually stunning last stand on a frozen lake that brings to mind the shock of early seasons of the HBO show and how it used to off fan-favorite characters in the blink of an eye, to emotionally devastating yet compelling results. That being said, Kingdom isn't above finding humor in horror, not only in the form of comic relief doofus Beom-pal (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/jun-seok-heo\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeon Seok-ho</a>), but also a fantastic yet hilarious scene where Chang literally piledrives a giant zombie into ice like he's at Wrestlemania.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3646656-https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joanmacdonald_files_2019_02_kingdom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646656\" data-ratio=\"0.59375\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.4%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3646656-https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joanmacdonald_files_2019_02_kingdom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646656\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3646656-https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joanmacdonald_files_2019_02_kingdom.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3646656-https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joanmacdonald_files_2019_02_kingdom.jpg 960w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/171/1712892/3646656-https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joanmacdonald_files_2019_02_kingdom.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">And if you think there's nothing new to be done with the mythology of zombies, think again. Season 2 of Kingdom doubles down on the viral aspect of the zombie outbreak, exploring its natural origin, how it spreads, and most frighteningly, how it evolves. In the Season 1 finale, we found out that the zombies aren't actually vulnerable to sunlight, but to warm temperatures. This season kept giving us new discoveries about the \"resurrection plant\" and actually treats the zombies as victims of a viral infection that controls their movements, rather than supernatural undead ghouls.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Netflix's Kingdom reaches new levels of terror given the context in which it was released, but even without the real news of scary viruses, this zombie show breathes new life into the genre by combining stunning action with an intriguing political plot and compelling characters whose suffering and deaths have actual impact. Kingdom shows that the zombie genre will never really go stale.</p>",

These humanoid husks are devoid of humanity, mechanized units designed to be disposable as they fight the second American civil war. Both sides sport bland three-letter initials, the NAC (New American Council) and the UPA (United Peoples of America), their full names reading like soulless corporate think-tanks, their motives as opaque as they are forgettable. Actual people are seemingly absent in this conflict. Lifelessness permeates the entire experience, sapping all interest in what is otherwise an accomplished tactical combat game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this sense, Corruption 2029 is a disappointing step backward from the developer's debut title, 2018's Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, a game that elevated the XCOM formula primarily through a charismatic cast of characters. The mechanics of combat work in essentially the same way they did in Mutant Year Zero with similarly distinguished results. You control a squad of three units (and occasionally a fourth unit you might acquire mid-mission) and you're able to explore the map in real-time until the enemy spots you or, preferably, you trigger an ambush. Once the fight's underway, you and the engaged enemies alternate between ducking behind cover, firing your weapons, lobbing grenades, and deploying special abilities in turn-based combat.</p><figure

of clarity. The UI conveys all the pertinent information flawlessly, leaving you reassured that each move you make is going to play out with a high degree of certainty and few unintended consequences. When deciding where to move, for example, you can hover over each accessible square on the grid and see your exact chance to hit every enemy in range with the weapon you have equipped. Swap that weapon and all the percentages update. Clear icons inform you that the destination is in low cover or high cover and if an enemy is currently flanking that position. Having these details reliably presented on-screen is a constant benefit to the decision-making process and goes a long way to ensure success in each combat encounter is determined by preparation and smart choices rather than an unexpected fluke.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It helps that the various systems that comprise combat don't get too bogged down in fine granularity. Everything--from hit point variations between enemy types to weapon characteristics and unit abilities--exhibits a meaningful difference. You're not faced with upgrades that add incremental effects, a slight movement or damage increase here, an extra grenade or hit point there, that only work to tweak your existing repertoire. Rather, the new gear you acquire and the new enemies you encounter deliver big, immediate differences that both afford additional strategies and demand you rethink your approach.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The excellent core combat is again bracketed by the same pre-battle stealth introduced in Mutant Year Zero. Here you're given the opportunity to scout the map before engaging the enemy on your own terms. It's extremely satisfying to sneak through an encampment, thinning out the enemy numbers one or two at a time as you go, before triggering the remaining units with the odds stacked more in your favour. I even managed to complete a few mission objectives without entering combat at all, just by paying close attention to patrol routes, taking advantage of distractions you can activate in the environment, and weaving my way through. The singular stealth approach to XCOM-bat is as craftily enjoyable here as it was in Mutant Year Zero.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, that's about where the favourable comparisons end. Despite depicting a connected series of maps, Corruption 2029 never comes together as a world. Even when a mission offers multiple objectives across two maps, when you complete the first objective you're able to instantly warp to the next map to tackle the second. Exacerbating the problem, missions regularly recycle maps, ostensibly seeing you return to previous areas to pursue a new objective, but really all you're doing is killing the same enemies again in a slightly different order. Revisiting a location works when you're able to perceive the passage of time and appreciate what's changed since you left, or when you're able to return with a new ability that allows for a new perspective. But it falls flat when all that's different is there are now two guards at the front gate instead of one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks in large part to this structure, the world of Corruption 2029 feels empty. It doesn't help that the story is also delivered in meagre fragments as dislocated as the map structure. A couple of skimpy sentences in a briefing screen and a handful of newspaper clippings found in the environment hardly add up to a compelling narrative. For a game all about war, little attention is paid to what you might actually be fighting for.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

especially after the feats of characterization found in Mutant Year Zero, is the utterly anonymous cast of characters. Each unit you control is a blank slate, a husk emptied of all personality, nothing more than a collection of movement and weapon stats. Indeed, even the unique skill trees that distinguished each character in the previous game are gone, replaced with a pool of abilities that you can swap in and out of your units' ability slots between missions, emphasising their disposable, interchangeable nature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Corruption 2029 is a strange, underwhelming followup. Its combat hits all the same highs as did Mutant Year Zero. I was having a blast every time I found myself in the middle of a tense, exciting firefight and able to survive by the skin of my teeth. But whenever I returned to the mission select screen I could feel my enthusiasm wane. And each time I dropped into the same map, to take out those same two enemies standing next to the same truck and hack the same computer to read the same email about the same world I didn't care about, I knew the war would soon be over. In the end, you've got to have a reason to keep fighting.</p>",

But at each step of the way, <a href=\"/half-life-alyx/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-504885\">Half-Life: Alyx</a> proves that almost everything the franchise did best is elevated by VR: the environmental puzzles that require a keen eye, the threat of a headcrab jumping for your face, the cryptic storytelling. The series' staples are as great as ever here, and in its most powerful moments, Half-Life: Alyx confidently shows you why it couldn't have been done any other way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What's a day in the life of Alyx Vance? In true Half-Life form, the entire game goes from morning to night in a single shot of first-person action in which you, as Alyx, trek through the undergrounds and abandoned zones of City 17. At first, it's to save your dad Eli Vance from the clutches of the Combine. However, you're subsequently led to uncover the nature of that massive floating structure that hovers over City 17, referred to as the Vault. With a cheeky sidekick Russell in your ear, and a trusty, prophetic Vortigaunt who comes in clutch, Alyx is more than prepared. A basic premise for sure, but the journey is thrilling, and the payoff is immense.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's a newfound intimacy captured in doing the things that Half-Life always asked of you. Because it's a VR game, the way you look at and process your surroundings fundamentally changes, thus making the solutions to environmental puzzles more of a personal accomplishment than before. Simply finding the right objects to progress was fine with a keyboard and mouse, but when it's your own hands turning valves, moving junk to find critical items, pulling levers, or hitting switches while turning your head to see the results of your actions, these become enticing gameplay mechanics rather than means for breaking up the pace. Without waypoints or objective markers to guide you, subtle visual cues and calculated level design lead you to the solutions, and progress feels earned because of that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You may not have the Gravity Gun here, but the spirit of its physics-based interaction lives through the Gravity Gloves, both as a sensible thematic fit and tool for proper VR gameplay. They allow you to magnetically pull in key objects from afar, and catching them midair is always satisfying--especially when snatching a grenade off a Combine soldier to throw it back in their face.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Not only has Half-Life: Alyx made good on its shift to VR, it has elevated many of the aspects we've come to love about Half-Life games.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">What's just as important is Alyx's multitool, which serves as a way to engage in <a href=\"/articles/half-life-alyx-multitool-puzzles-guide-how-to-solv/1100-6475047/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475047\">the game's simple yet enjoyable spatial puzzles</a>. Rewiring circuitry to unlock paths forward is the multitool's most crucial function, though, so you'll need a sharp eye for tracing where wires and circuits lead and use the multitool's capability of exposing the flow of currents. Trying to find solutions can be frustrating at times, but once you understand the rules, how they grow more complex and incorporate the environment as the game goes on, it then gives way to a sense of accomplishment.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646081-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h04m07s848.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646081\" data-ratio=\"0.5627931214174\" data-width=\"1919\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1919px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646081-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h04m07s848.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646081\"><img alt=\"Once you get the hang of its mechanics, combat ramps up the intensity.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646081-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h04m07s848.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646081-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h04m07s848.png 1919w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646081-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h04m07s848.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3646081-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h04m07s848.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Once you get the hang of its mechanics, combat ramps up the intensity.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Half-Life: Alyx revolves around the balance of the aforementioned puzzle elements and its suspenseful combat scenarios. It may not have many of the bombastic firefights, helicopter chases, or seemingly insurmountable enemies from the series' past--most of that's been exchanged for close encounters, sometimes tapping into a horror element that Half-Life had only previously toyed with.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Headcrabs aren't the annoying pests they were before; at times, they're terrifying because they will literally latch onto your head or cause the occasional jump scare. The same goes for Barnacles; trust me when I say that you do not want your own virtual body dragged up toward the ceiling by its disgusting slimy tongue. Other scenarios play on navigating pitch-black darkness with your wrist-mounted flashlight as Xen creatures lurk about. There's also an entire chapter dedicated to \"Jeff,\" an invincible mutant with sharp hearing who can't see, and he must be dealt with through clever environmental manipulation. A genuine dread you might not expect from Half-Life lingers throughout.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Combine soldiers may still be knobheads, but when they're chasing you down in VR and your sick headshot skills aren't there to save you, their threat becomes imminent and sometimes nerve-wracking. You'll hear the familiar radio chatter of the Combine, and feel relieved at the sound of the recognizable flatlining ring of a fallen Combine soldier. It's also nostalgic and oddly comforting to hear those signature old-school techno beats during most of these heated firefights, and then heal up on a health charger that uses the same sound effect since Half-Life 1. There aren't many types of Combine soldiers or styles of encounters, but I was always eager to face them head-on in each scenario.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

href=\"/articles/half-life-alyx-weapon-upgrade-and-items-guide/1100-6475048/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475048\">when it comes to weapons, with only a pistol, shotgun, and SMG</a>. However, all three have a few upgrades to make them more effective, which must be done at Combine Fabricator stations at certain points in the game. The only real collectible is Resin, and pieces are scattered about each level. With ammo often scarce and Resin tucked away in corners, scavenging is a core element, further emphasizing Alyx's scrappy nature. And honestly, the slim arsenal fits the types of combat sequences throughout the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's as satisfying to take your punchy shotgun to a Combine heavy as it is to ignite conveniently placed explode-y red barrels or clip weak points off Antlions with well-placed pistol shots when four or five of them are fast approaching. That's plenty to juggle in VR and strikes a balance between being simple enough to handle and complex enough to take advantage of VR's unique aspects. You'll physically duck in and out of cover and peek around corners ready to bust shots, and frantically string together the fun reload gestures as enemies barrel down on you--these are the qualities of any good VR shooter, though here, in its distinctly Half-Life form.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When looking at gameplay as a whole, Half-Life: Alyx takes many of the concepts we've seen evolve since VR's inception and distills them to their fundamentals. It executes most of them to a T, thus creating a VR experience that's a full, cohesive whole. A number of <a href=\"/articles/half-life-alyx-accessibility-options-guide/1100-6475045/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475045\">accessibility options are available</a> as well; different movement and turning styles can help mitigate motion sickness, and there's a single-controller mode that allows you to performing all the game's necessary actions on one hand. You can also have crouching and standing actions mapped to buttons for height adjustment, making <a href=\"/articles/how-to-play-half-life-alyx-seated/1100-6475084/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6475084\">the seated VR experience</a> better.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646082\" data-ratio=\"0.5627931214174\" data-width=\"1919\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1919px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646082\"><img alt=\"Fighting the Combine will bring back memories of Half-Life 2 with their radio chatter and flatline ring.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.png 1919w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fighting the Combine will bring back memories of Half-Life 2 with their radio chatter and flatline ring.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.png 1919w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3646082-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-01h56m34s917.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting the Combine will bring back memories of Half-Life 2 with their radio chatter and flatline ring.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">That said, environmental interaction isn't perfect. Doors and mechanisms you need to grip don't always react to your movements the way you'd expect, and sometimes there are just too many unimportant objects scattered about that obscure the thing you're actually trying to pull in with your Gravity Gloves. Thankfully, these instances are rare enough as to not drag down otherwise intuitive mechanics.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For as well-executed as its various elements are, the front half of the game does settle into a bit of routine. You may start to see through some of the trite aspects of the combat challenges, scripted sequences, and reliance on narrow corridors for stretches. At one point, I wondered where the game was going or why I was putting in this effort to get to this mysterious floating vault. But there comes a turning point, and the practiced routines pay off as you begin to feel the game's increasingly dangerous atmosphere.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\">The very concept of VR becomes the core narrative device--your hands, and by extension, Alyx's actions, are fundamental to the delivery of its best moments.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">You'll be struck by the awe-inspiring sights throughout the journey across City 17, the thrill of firefights that ramp up in intensity while performing the VR-specific mechanics, and the unbearable suspense of some levels. Yet all those pale in comparison to the final hour, when Half-Life: Alyx solidifies itself as the boldest the series has ever been.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The very concept of VR becomes the core narrative device--your hands, and by extension, Alyx's actions, are fundamental to the delivery of its best moments. In its finality, you'll truly understand why VR was the only way this game could have even existed--it's something surreal, revelatory, and incredibly empowering. Half-Life: Alyx has far-reaching implications for the future of the franchise, both in where it goes next and what forms future games can even take. And in true Half-Life fashion, more questions than answers linger, but for good reason and not without a reminder of why you love the series to begin with.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646075\" data-ratio=\"0.5627931214174\" data-width=\"1919\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1919px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3646075\"><img alt=\"Some views across City 17 are breathtaking, especially in VR.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.png 1919w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some views across City 17 are breathtaking, especially in VR.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.png 1919w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3646075-vlcsnap-2020-03-23-02h12m46s305.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some views across City 17 are breathtaking, especially in VR.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, this game is somewhat of a companion piece to mainline Half-Life games, taking place five years before Half-Life 2, but that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Disappointment you may have felt in its 13-year hiatus will feel like water under the bridge, and in a way, have played into just how powerful Half-Life: Alyx turned out to be. The names, the faces, the iconic objects that have become synonymous with Half-Life have their specific place. And if you weren't aware previously, you'll see just how important Alyx Vance--the series' most infallible personality--has been the entire time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not only has Half-Life: Alyx made good on its shift to VR, it has elevated many of the aspects we've come to love about Half-Life games. It may not be as bombastic as previous games, but the intimacy of VR brings you closer to a world you might have thought you knew over the past 22 years. Even when familiarity starts to settle in, its gameplay systems still shine as a cohesive whole. And as it concludes, Half-Life: Alyx hits you with something unforgettable, transcending VR tropes for one of gaming's greatest moments.</p><p> </p>",

The COVID-19 coronavirus has disrupted sports across the globe, and baseball is no different, as Opening Day of the 2020 Major League Baseball season was recently postponed for at least the next two months--and even that seems optimistic. It's an unfathomable turn of events, yet it also means Sony San Diego's latest baseball sim is now one of the only ways to experience the 2020 season of America's favorite pastime. It's a good job, then, that MLB 20 maintains the series' consistently high quality. Refinements to fielding and hitting may only be incremental this year, but they add more depth to what is still one of the most compelling sports games on the market, while new additions and modes off the field increase the game's variety as you chart a course towards World Series glory.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fielding and defense received a lot of love in last year's game, so MLB 20 adds a few more wrinkles without rocking the boat too much. The distinction between Gold Glove caliber outfielders and mere mortals is now slightly more pronounced, particularly when the CPU is in control. The best outfielders in the game are much more dialed in this year, reacting to the ball off the bat with authentic accuracy and a dependable first-step. On the flip side, the square peg you've lodged into the round hole in left field might struggle when it comes to reading the flight of the ball, committing a fair few errors over the course of a season as balls careen off the edge of his glove instead of nesting in its palm.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

that identifies those bloop singles and hard-sinking line drives that are right on the edge of being catchable. If you have a player like Minnesota Twins center fielder Byron Buxton patrolling the outfield, you might take a chance and attempt a risky diving catch on one of these tough-to-reach balls, knowing full well that he's skilled enough to pull off a spectacular grab. With an average defender hustling towards the ball, however, you might prefer to play it safe and get yourself in position to gather the ball after it bounces. Surrendering a single is a much more positive outcome than laying out for a catch and completely missing the ball, resulting in a triple for the fortunate hitter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Snagging that single might even give you the opportunity to use MLB 20's new Throw Home Indicator. Nailing the small needle in the center of an outfielder's throwing meter will see them launch the ball towards home with as much power and accuracy as they can possibly muster, giving you a greater chance of recording one of those bang-bang plays at home plate. It's a smart, albeit subtle, addition to the game, which is true of all of these improvements to the game's fielding. It's possible you won't even see the Extreme Catch Indicator until 20 games in, but they each add more dynamism to the outfield, and the best defenders may even influence your strategy when stepping into the batter's box, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When it comes to hitting, the Plate Coverage Indicator (or PCI) has been redesigned in MLB 20 to give you a better idea of the type of hitter you have at the plate and how you should approach their at-bat. When using the default PCI, the outer reticle displays your batter's plate vision, while the inner reticle represents their ability to make contact. Previously, the PCI consisted of an average between these two attributes, so there was some vexing guesswork involved when trying to square up the ball and make solid contact. Splitting these attributes up with seperate reticles illustrates exactly what your hitter's contact and vision are, offering an immediate distinction between good and bad hitters (with each reticle varying in size based on the player's skill), and providing you with better feedback for lining up the PCI in the optimal position.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This all ties into the new Perfect/Perfect system that gives you the best possible chance of having a productive at-bat. The first part of this new mechanic is displayed by three dots in the centre of each player's PCI. From top to bottom the dots represent fly balls, line drives, and ground balls. If a player's top dot is bigger than the other two, then you know he excels at launching powerful fly balls into the stratosphere. A bigger bottom dot, meanwhile, means you'll want to try and focus on sending hard-hit ground balls through gaps in the infield. If you manage to line up the PCI so that the ball connects with one of these dots and your swing timing is absolutely perfect, you'll be rewarded with Perfect/Perfect contact and the auditory euphoria that comes from the crack of the bat.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This new distinction results in high exit velocities and a significant chance the ball will fall for a hit if it doesn't just wind up in the stands. The redesign of the PCI and the addition of the Perfect/Perfect system adds more layers to MLB 20's batting that rewards you for guessing a pitch's location, having immaculate timing, and playing to each player's strengths. With these new tools at your disposal, you're given more control over the outcome of each at bat. That doesn't mean you're suddenly going to start hitting .500, and you may only execute a Perfect/Perfect hit once or twice each game, but the feedback you're given after every swing of the bat feels more pertinent, and there's a tangible consistency to the way hitting works, with solid contact resulting in hard-hit balls instead of weak lineouts, as was often the case in MLB 19.</p><figure

Franchise experience with a couple of additions. You now have the ability to add custom teams to your Franchise by replacing a current team with one of your own. You can change the name, design your own uniforms, and select a home venue--whether it's the historic Polo Grounds or the Texas Rangers' brand-spanking-new Globe Life Field. The fact you can't pick the roster means this isn't quite the expansion team mode the community has wanted for years now. It's a small step in the right direction, though, even if the execution is a tad underwhelming. If you opt for a fantasy draft or force some trades, you can somewhat emulate the experience of adding an expansion franchise to the league, but it's not as involved as it could be.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The most significant new addition is the inclusion of full Minor League rosters. In the past, the community would create its own custom rosters from scratch, replacing every Joe Random with the top prospects and Double-A veterans from each team's MiLB affiliate. Now these players are included straight out of the box, with real names, accurate stats, and even face scans in some cases. Instead of waiting weeks for the community to come up with the goods, you can now start Franchise mode and have an entire organisation's roster at your disposal from the get-go, including players like Gavin Lux, Wander Franco, and Luis Robert.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Elsewhere, Online Leagues make their return in MLB 20. These are customisable one-off seasons that give you a lot of options when it comes to setting up a league with friends. You can even use your Diamond Dynasty rosters, which is a nice addition. The problem is that there are none of the aforementioned Minor League teams to call up players from, nor is there a draft or any sort of free agency. It's a one and done season with no CPU teams--a far cry from the robust Online Franchise mode that was once a part of the season and is still a feature in other sports games. Again, Online Leagues is a small step in the right direction, and it's great being able to play competitively with a group of friends, but one would hope Online Franchise returns in some form in the next iteration of The Show.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3645666\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3645666\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3645666-mlb%28r%29%20the%20show%28tm%29%2020_40.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Diamond Dynasty also received a lot of love last year, so MLB 20 doesn't mess with the formula too much. There's a new Showdown mode that's sort of like a mix between Moments and Battle Royale. You begin by drafting a skeleton crew of players and then play through a series of scenarios that are often based on significant moments in baseball history. You won't know exactly what challenges await, but every playthrough ends in a Showdown against a formidable pitcher, where you're tasked with coming back from a variable deficit before recording 15 outs. Each challenge you complete along the way gives you the opportunity to draft more players to improve your team, unlock special perks, and add runs to your final score in order to reduce the deficit you need to fight back from. It's a fun mode that gives you another way to play Diamond Dynasty, sample some of the best players, and unlock rewards, especially if you don't touch the multiplayer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">March to October and Road to the Show have received some similarly minor improvements. The latter still offers the same truncated season experience, only now you can influence your team's roster moves with trades and Minor League call-ups. RTTS, meanwhile, allows player relationships to develop on the field as well as during locker room conversations. Building a rapport with your teammates will unlock useful perks throughout the season, and they now feel more natural. Play as a shortstop, for example, and you're likely to improve your relationship with the first baseman by spraying accurate throws his way. The addition of Minor League players pays dividends in RTTS, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">MLB The Show 20 doesn't make any large strides forward, choosing instead to focus on refining areas that needed improvement from last year. This results in a game that feels more balanced in terms of variety across an assortment of game modes, while the action on the diamond has been tightened up with rewarding consistency and added dynamism that maintains the series' lofty standards. It's the ideal foundation to build upon as the PlayStation 5 looms on the horizon, and with the baseball season suspended for the foreseeable future, MLB 20 goes some way to filling an empty space in our pursuit for escapism.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The Spanish dystopian sci-fi satire The Platform has been set for a Netflix release for a while. The streaming giant bought the distribution rights when the movie made its US premiere at Fantastic Fest in September 2019, and the plan was always to release it sometime in 2020. But at that stage no one could have predicted how horribly apt the release of a movie in which isolation and food shortage play a key part of the plot would be in March 2020.</p><p>Like many of the best dystopian sci-fi movies--from Planet of the Apes to Escape from New York--The Platform takes modern life to a chilling extreme. At some point in the future, prisoners are placed into a narrow skyscraper-like construction consisting of hundreds of levels, known amongst the inmates as the pit. Each level is occupied by two people, with a gap in the center through which a large platform passes daily. At the start of each day, the platform is loaded with an incredible array of food--slowly it descends through the pit, giving the inhabitants at each stage a few minutes to grab what they can. The further the platform descends, the less food there will be for those on the lower levels. Each inmate duo starts every month randomly assigned to a new level--it could be one of the higher levels, where food is plentiful, or down below with only a few scraps.</p><p>The Platform is not a subtle movie, and its influences are obvious. The 1997 cult sci-fi favorite Cube is an obvious comparison, with its protagonists trapped in a room in a mysterious futuristic building, as is Snowpiercer, with its inventive take on class and social divisions. Surreal Spanish director Luis Buñuel's The Exterminating Angel is another; this 1962 classic focuses on a group of upper-class dinner guests who find they cannot leave the room and descend into a primal state. And there are also shades of groundbreaking writers JG Ballard and Samuel Beckett, and their dark dystopian visions and absurdist comedy respectively.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/3645566-platform2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3645566\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/3645566-platform2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3645566\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/3645566-platform2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/3645566-platform2.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1557/15576725/3645566-platform2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p>Thankfully, the film is far more than the sum of its influences. It focuses on an average man named Goreng, who unlike most of the other criminal inmates, has willingly submitted himself to the pit--or the \"Vertical Self-Management Center,\" to give the structure its official name. We see Goreng signing up for the process with a non-nonsense beaurocrat--the deal is that if he stays eight months, he will gain an important academic qualification. It's a smart move from writers David Desola and Pedro Rivero and director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, because while the other characters that Goreng encounters are, by turns, funny, scary, strange, and sad, none of them are--unsurprisingly--particularly sympathetic.</p><p>The longer Goreng stays in the pit--sometimes near the top, other times towards the bottom--the more he realizes that there is a chance for everyone. \"Eat your share and prepare two similar ones for the next level\" becomes his mantra--if everyone takes just enough food for themselves then there will be enough for everyone. But this is not how desperate humans work, and soon he begins to devise a plan to close down the whole system.</p><p>The first part of the movie focuses on Goreng's time with Trimagasi, an elderly man with a particular affection for his knife, with whom he develops an unlikely friendship. The movie adopts a heightened and darkly humorous tone from the start, and much of Goreng and Trimagasi's interaction is very funny. Until it all heads into a very unpleasant place, that is. Ultimately, all anyone is really interested in is their own survival, and when people get hungry, they are driven to desperate behavior. So be warned, at times The Platform is as much a grueling horror movie as it is a sci-fi thriller or black comedy, with some deeply unsettling moments.</p><p>Unlike many movies that use (or reuse) a single setting, The Platform never feels overly theatrical or constrained by a lack of budget. Azegiñe Urigoitia's brilliant production design and Gaztelu-Urrutia's inventive direction create a claustrophobic and believable self-contained environment that stretches thousands of feet in either direction. Viewers expecting to learn more about the world beyond the pit might be disappointed--this isn't Westworld. The focus is purely on the poor people who have to exist within this appalling situation, and the way human nature reacts to the most extreme of circumstances.</p><p>While the movie is never boring, Gaztelu-Urrutia's does push the concept to its limits--after 90 minutes you'll be as desperate to leave the pit as its inhabitants. But that's really the point, and it’s impressive how well he juggles humor, gore, thrills, and social commentary without letting any one aspect overwhelm the other. This might be either the best time or the worst time to watch a movie like The Platform, but if you do venture down into the pit, it's a journey you won't quickly forget.</p>",

            "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The first season of Beastars arrived on US Netflix on March 13, and it's the anime that everybody should be watching. Combining the holy powers of both horniness and genuine thoughtfulness about identity, sexuality, and society, Beastars lays out both a cerebral and emotional treat over the course of 12 episodes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But first: Yes, Beastars is that series openly embraced by furries across the internet, and Netflix acknowledged it as so by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1237489546746445824\">calling furries to the frontlines</a> for the US release of Beastars. If you're a furry or a curious individual, anthropomorphic animals do have sex in the show. Not graphically, but it's a thing. For the extreme perverts among us, a chicken enjoys watching a wolf eat a sandwich made with her eggs. Make of that what you will!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beastars is an adaptation of the manga of the same name by Paru Itagaki. It's set in a civilized anthropomorphic society where herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores coexist without getting eaten or eating each other. As you can imagine, that's pretty hard to do when you have rabbits and wolves in close contact.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So Beastar's premise is like an experiment: What happens when you do try to get herbivores and carnivores under one metaphorical social roof? What happens when one subset of the population has an extreme physical advantage over the other? Cleverly, Beastars doesn't try to answer that complicated question all at once. It instead drops us into a relatively controlled environment, the boarding school called Cherryton Academy, and focuses on one subset of students in particular: the drama club.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This focus group gets complicated enough, even though it's just a handful of characters. We get a closeup of each student's thoughts and frustrations about speciesism, predator versus prey complexes, and sexism. Legosi, a timid but huge grey wolf, is our protagonist. He's a wolf torn over being a predator, who feels uncomfortable with his violent instincts. Legosi is also struggling with romantic feelings for a white dwarf rabbit, Haru.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But Legosi is not the only character with issues over identity and relationships to other species. Being a predator or prey is the source of many characters' deep insecurities. Louis, the red deer who's the seemingly untouchable president of the drama club, refuses to show any weakness and clashes with Legosi over the wolf's willingness to always avoid conflict. The deer views it as a personal insult that somebody like a wolf would want to be weak. Haru takes issues with always being considered cute and weak, and uses her sexuality as a coping mechanism. She considers slut-shaming and ostracization the lesser evil compared to being wrongly perceived.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The real charm of Beastars lies with the time it devotes to each of the characters' depth, and the relationships between the students. The members of the main cast are young and complex, navigating the path of defining themselves, but finding that there is truly no easy answer. No one's a trope, as much as the students, and even we the viewers, try to stuff them into boxes based on their animal attributes. Legosi says it best when he thinks about Haru: She's not just what the disdainful rumors say she is. His personal experience in her company shows him otherwise. And as much as the buck is perceived as a regal creature, Louis perhaps hides the grittiest, most violent tendencies of all the students.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The relationship between Legosi and Haru, a wolf and rabbit, is nuanced and works well as the anchor of the story in Season 1. They're unlikely partners--a shy wolf and an assertive rabbit--but their burgeoning relationship challenges each character to grow and sets the stage for them to think about who they are and are not as a wolf and rabbit. Legosi does almost kill her in the beginning of the show, and Haru's near-death experience isn't downplayed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Death is a legitimate risk if they get together, and Legosi and Haru respond to that by thinking carefully about the responsibility they have toward each other. Their romance feels important to both students' growth and internal shifts, rather than a romance for romance's sake. On the romance note, Legosi's other love interest, Juno, also doesn't fall in a neat tidy box. You think she's going to go the conniving love rival route, but Juno's more complex than that. It's a 180 when it's revealed her goals are probably more about dethroning Louis than attaining Legosi. But there's a caveat: Although the female characters are refreshing in construct and like, actually multifaceted, Beastars fails the Bechdel test.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As for how good the on-screen adaptation of Beastars is, the CGI animation is relatively decent and doesn't feel too jarring, as some CGI shows can be. The creators also add in stylistic 2D animation to depict flashbacks and dreams, and those scenes really give the show the dynamism that the CGI scenes lack. However, for the anthropomorphic animal characters, a lot of their movements seem to be missing animal-specific characteristics. A wolf doesn't move the same as a smaller animal, and yet they pretty much do in the show. It's disappointing, but doesn't detract too much from the overall story.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beastars is one of the most interesting manga to come out in the last few years. Beastars isn't interested in a tidy equality message per se--it's more concerned with exploring what the characters think equality is, unpacking that, dumping it on the floor, and watching them slip and slide in the mess. It's a glorious and complicated examination of power (both physical and via capital resources) and social relationships through the lens of an anthropomorphic society.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Beastars is a show to watch for furries and non-furries alike, and good news: Season 2 is already in production.</p>",

Not only is it a smarter way to ensure it's not tied to each annual release in the series, but Warzone gives the series its own identity within the competitive genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It might not be apparent at first, though, especially when you take into consideration how much Warzone borrows from other popular battle royale games. It incorporates a ping system similar to the one in Apex Legends, letting you tag enemy positions, points of interest, and loot for teammates at the press of a button (albeit mapped to a button that's harder to reach quickly, mitigating some of its convenience). It plays out on a massive map akin to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, where large swathes of open land are ripe for snipers while dense suburbs make for exhilarating and chaotic close-quarters skirmishes. And like the ones in Fortnite, color-coded chests overflowing with loot are easy to hunt down when you are within earshot of their signature emanating jingle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">None of these competitors are defined solely by the elements Warzone borrows from them, and Warzone isn't defined by the sum of their parts. Instead, Warzone uses them to establish a solid foundation for its own distinct elements. It starts with a larger player count than the aforementioned battle royale games, with Warzone currently supporting up to 150 players per match, with modes for three-person squads or solo play. Having so many players active at once keeps you constantly on alert, but also increases the odds that you'll at least have some action (and likely a handful of kills) each match. This makes even some of the least successful drops feel worthwhile--even if your entire match lasts only a handful of minutes, you'll likely get some valuable time in with some weapons, better preparing you for another fight in the next match.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You're likely to feel right at home with many areas of Warzone's map, too, if you've already been playing Modern Warfare. Many of its named areas use identical layouts as those in Modern Warfare proper as well as previous installments, so you can navigate them using muscle memory--and they're intuitive enough to learn from scratch, too. Breaking up large swathes of dangerously open fields are dense and cramped suburbs filled with tall high-rises or mazes of storage rooms. It's easy to lose pursuers in the twisting streets of Downtown or hide in the large industrial factories of the Lumberyard, rewarding your memory of their respective layouts as you turn an ambush into an opportunity to attack. Large buildings can get frustrating with their long stairwells as loot is only hidden on the ground and top floors, but even these force you to think about what advantages you might reap with the extra elevation against the disadvantages of trapping yourself in a narrow hallway to get there first.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Warzone minimizes downtime, encouraging you to get into a fight with an aggressively fast closing circle and streamlined mechanics governing your loot. Unlike most other games in the genre, Warzone doesn't task you with micro-managing items in a limited-space backpack. Instead, you have pre-defined slots of ammunition types, armour-plating, and cash. The rest of your loadout works identically to a standard Modern Warfare multiplayer match--you have two weapon slots, one lethal grenade and one utility grenade slot each, and one slot for field equipment (perks like FMJ ammunition, recon drones, and more).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Weapons drop with attachments already equipped based on their overall rarity (this ranges from the stock white drops to fully kitted-out orange ones), and there's no option to customize them outside of what they already feature. This makes early looting extremely quick. It's easy to find two suitable primary weapons and stockpile some ammunition early on, which lets you focus more on hunting other players than staying out of sight in pursuit of attachments to your gear. It also feeds into Warzone's changes to both an in-game economy and its principles around respawning, both of which benefit from allowing you to go from your starting pistol to battle-ready in a few minutes flat.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

Warzone's spin on the genre. You earn cash by looting it, killing other players, or completing small optional objectives (such as hunting down another player or securing an area for a short time). Buy stations are littered around the map, and if you have the cash, you can spend it on useful killsteaks like UAVs, airstrikes, and shield turrets--but also on useful gear like additional armour-plating and self-revive kits. The most expensive purchase is a full loadout drop, letting you airdrop in a crate and equip your squad with their own handcrafted loadouts and perks from their own inventories.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the largest twist in Warzone in terms of its effect on the overall focus of the mode. Other battle royales force you to make do with what you can scavenge, but Warzone shifts that focus on collecting as much cash as you can and getting the loadout of your choice. Despite being the most expensive purchase right now, it's incredibly easy for a team of three players to collectively gather enough money within the opening moments of a match to secure their premade loadouts. It's already common to find players using thermal scopes and the Cold-Blooded perk to combat it, but generally, the inclusion of a loadout drop dilutes the dynamism of matches by making loot count for a lot less. It's no longer a scrappy rush to try and equip yourself with what you can find, but a brief interlude before hunting other players with weapons you've specifically chosen for Warzone and its structure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I found more fun in matches where I was playing on the edge, forced to make do with average-rated weapons with poor scopes that forced me to pick my battles wisely. There's opportunity for this not only at the start of a Warzone match, but throughout one, too, thanks to a liberal respawn system that frequently feeds you back into the game. When you're killed for the first time, you're transported to the Gulag and forced to face off against one other player to secure your freedom and respawn into the match. Set in a cramped shower room in a derelict prison, these bouts are quick and messy, rewarding fast reflexes and pinpoint aim. It feels great to earn your place back in a match after a disappointing death, but it also places you immediately on the backfoot as you're spawned back in without any of your loot. This is especially challenging to overcome when playing solo, where you can't rely on your teammates to secure your landing or help you find new weapons with some security.</p><figure

Gulag, or subsequently die after having respawned, you can still be revived indefinitely by teammates at buy stations (if you're playing with a squad, of course). There's a hefty fee attributed to each respawn, but it's low enough to encourage your squad to seek out your revival without giving up on it entirely once you've gone down. It also redefines what a death means in battle royale. Warzone doesn't let you linger after a successful skirmish, forcing you to hurry through your opponents' dropped loot and prepare for the possibility of retaliation. It keeps you looking over your shoulder at all times, scanning the horizon for a vengeful scope taking aim at your head. It's equally exhilarating to lose to a squad and deliver retribution after a quick visit to the Gulag. Fighting back from nothing to overcome your rivals is incredibly rewarding whether you're playing with a team or solo, though in squads you have more opportunities to do so.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to Warzone's standard battle royale mode is Plunder, which is far less noteworthy than the main attraction despite being a new game mode entirely. Set on the same map and with the same 150 players split into teams of three, Plunder shifts the objective from survival to looting. The overall goal is to hoard as much cash as you can, depositing your personal stashes at helicopter drop points similar to those in The Division's Dark Zone. Squads currently leading the standings are marked on the map, giving you a clear view of your competitors and attracting players to common areas for largely chaotic fights. Respawns are unlimited in Plunder too; dying only penalizes you by resetting your carried cash and forcing you to sit through a lengthy respawn timer.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3645283\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3645283\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg 3840w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3645283-call%20of%20duty%C2%AE_%20modern%20warfare%C2%AE_20200315181035.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Plunder is sound mechanically, but it's simply unexciting. The matches take far too long, limited to either 30 minutes or until a squad has collectively banked $1 million. For the most part the majority of players are centralized on one part of the map, all fighting over the same pool of money in firefights where bullets are coming from every direction. Even though rattle royale lacks a strict structure, its closing circle does move players in a common direction, which forces dynamic skirmishes that can lead to exciting and unexpected gameplay stories. Plunder's static nature lacks the same excitement.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Warzone is a great sophomore attempt at a battle royale from Call of Duty, which finally manages to carve out its own identity with interesting spins on the existing formula. Its subversion of death and the nail-biting Gulag duels give you more ways to stay in a match, while also forcing you to be aware of your surroundings even after wiping a rival squad. Its looting is streamlined enough to make early moments feel fast, but Warzone also loses some of the messy magic from hobbled together loadouts by letting you drop in prebuilt ones far too easily and frequently. Still, if you're comfortable with Call of Duty's latest iteration of multiplayer antics and thrive in the stressful setting of battle royales, Warzone is a strong contender for your attention.</p>",

It was fast and intense, full of huge monsters and scorching metal tracks, modernizing the feel of the 1990s original while adding some new-school flourishes. Where Doom 2016 brought the original Doom into the present, <a href=\"/doom-eternal/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-483372\">Doom Eternal</a> feels like a big step forward in making the franchise something new: It's a master class in demon dismemberment after the introductory course to ripping and tearing of four years ago. Like its predecessor, Doom Eternal makes you feel like a monster-shredding badass--not just because you're the strongest Doom Slayer, but because you're also the smartest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Doom Eternal is all about effectively using the huge amount of murder tools at your disposal. Health, armor, and ammo pickups are at a minimum in Eternal's many combat arenas, and the game instead requires you to earn these by massacring monsters in a variety of different ways. Stagger an enemy and you can tear them apart with a brutal glory kill, which refills your health; douse a demon with the new flamethrower and they'll start to spout armor pickups; or cut them in half with the chainsaw to grab some much-needed ammo.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In order to stay alive, you can't just run around blasting madly, expecting to tear through everything in your path; you have to run around blasting <em>rationally</em> to keep yourself at fighting strength. Keeping all your numbers up means continually rotating through your glory, chainsaw, and flamethrower kills while also making sure you're using the right gun for a particular job. Many of the toughest enemies now have weak points that allow you to snipe off their most lethal weapons, and you'll need to assess threats and knock them out quickly.</p><figure data-align=\"center\"

provides an altogether unwieldy list of things to manage. Between all its weapons and tools, their various ammo counters, and your health, it can all become overwhelming. With so much to keep in mind at all times, it takes a bit to get accustomed to Doom Eternal. And constantly pausing the action to pull up your weapon wheel to check ammo counters and decide which weapon to use on the monster about to tear your face off can feel antithetical to Doom's run-and-gun, rip-apart-everything approach.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you get the hang of it, though, all of Doom Eternal's many elements come together in a cascade of mayhem that makes you into the brainiest killing machine around. This isn't the kind of shooter in which your twitch reactions and aiming skills will carry you through; Eternal is a game in which you have to be constantly plotting your next move, executing a calculus of carnage to keep yourself alive and make everything else dead. Every moment is about analyzing the battlefield to find the next enemy you can stagger and slice apart for health or ammo, figuring out which enemy is your top priority and what guns you'll need to take it out safely, and where you need to head next in order to take the shots you need or keep the creatures chasing you from getting their own chance to rip and tear.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The mental math of figuring out how to keep yourself alive is a big part of what makes the game fun, but it's the improved mobility that really lets Doom Eternal kick off a metal guitar solo and start shredding. Every big battle takes place in a multi-level arena adorned with jump pads and monkey bars that let you get around quickly, and you also have a double-jump and horizontal dash move for avoiding attacks and crossing distances. A few arenas have their irritations, especially those where it's easy to trap yourself in a tight corner or back over a cliff, but mostly, Eternal's level design provides plenty of opportunities to zip around like a bat out of hell, constantly finding your next target and assessing if you need to set it on fire, freeze it, cut it in half, tear it apart, or some combination of all of them. It all makes just about every fight feel like a speeding train seconds from going off the rails, with disaster only averted because you're so damn good at killing stuff. Once you get the rhythm of Doom Eternal, it becomes a brilliant extension of what made Doom 2016 so cool.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Between battles, you spend your time using Eternal's mobility to navigate its sprawling, twisting levels, and to uncover myriad secret locations that hide upgrades and weapon mods. There's an even bigger emphasis on platforming than in Doom 2016, and puzzling through the environments to get around provides a welcome breather between fights. Some of the platforming can be a bit trying at times, especially when you need to clear big gaps to grab distant monkey bars or hit sticky walls you can climb. For the most part, though, navigating the environment is almost as much fun as smashing through Hell's armies. These portions are also pretty forgiving, thanks to the fact that falling into the abyss now only penalizes you with a small loss of health instead of instant death.</p><figure data-align=\"center\"

to complete, and that included tracking down the vast majority of secrets and completing a lot of the optional fights that earn you additional upgrade points. Running throughout is a pretty involved story, which feels like a fundamental shift from the satirical, jokey tale of Doom 2016. Where that game put you in the Praetor suit of a Doomslayer who literally destroyed the radios trying to provide context for his endless massacres, Doom Eternal is much more self-serious, constantly spewing proper nouns and character names as if you're intimately familiar with all the actors leading Hell's invasion of Earth. Some of the humor of the last game remains, but the majority is all pretty tough to follow if you don't spend time reading through the <em>many</em> collectible lore drops scattered around every level. Thankfully, keeping up with Eternal's confusing plot isn't really a necessary component of enjoying the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the main campaign, Doom Eternal also includes a multiplayer mode called Battlemode. It foregoes the more traditional deathmatch approach of Doom 2016, in which a bunch of players grab the Doom Slayer's weapons and shoot each other, for an experience in which one combatant takes on the role of the Slayer, fighting a team of two opponents who play as demons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Slayer-versus-demons approach of Eternal's multiplayer helps maintain the puzzle-like feel of its combat, while ratcheting up the challenge by giving demons the ability to strategize and work together. Demons also have a bunch of special abilities--they can summon smaller enemies to fight for them, block the Slayer's ability to pick up loot for a short time to stop them from healing, create traps, or share buffs. Battlemode is an interesting take on Eternal's battles, requiring you to use all your skills against intelligent enemies as the Slayer and to execute coordinated assaults as the relatively weaker demons. Playing as the demons puts things at a slower pace but captures a different, more tactical aspect of the battle calculations that are central to Doom Eternal's gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Eternal's multiplayer is a fun change of pace, especially with the opportunity to play as the demons, but its steep learning curve means it's a bit alienating to drop into, particularly if you haven't put significant time into the campaign. There's a lot to keep in mind no matter what role you take on in Battlemode, making it a tough multiplayer experience to get good at. The mode also doesn't add too much variety to the Eternal formula--for Slayer players, it's mostly just a more challenging version of Eternal's campaign. Taking on the demon role lets you try one of five different hellions, but while each plays a little differently, the gist of each is pretty much the same: Summon demons, shoot the Slayer. Battlemode is a nice diversion, but it's not the major draw of Eternal by any stretch, and the novelty of facing off against other humans doesn't add much to the game's underlying formula.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though it can take a bit to get the hang of it, the intricacies of Doom Eternal's combat, combined with its enhanced mobility and option-heavy level design, create a ton of white-knuckle moments that elevate everything that made Doom 2016 work so well. Its combat is just as quick and chaotic, but requires you to constantly analyze everything that's happening in order to come out victorious. Once you get the hang of the rhythm of Doom Eternal, it'll make you feel like a demon-slaying savant.</p><p> </p>",

Having such a wholesome game during an objectively bad time has been something of a blessing for a lot of people, myself included, and I'd be lying if I said it hasn't affected how I play New Horizons. I find myself turning to the game at night when I can't sleep, or during the day when I'm stressed and I need a break. More often than not, an adorable villager or even just a sense of accomplishment from finishing my chores will cheer me up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But that alone is not what defines New Horizons. The times I go to the game when I'm in a <em>good</em> mood are just as important as the times I'm seeking comfort. Even if I end the day anxious, I wake up excited to see what's new on my island. I can't wait to see who's visiting for the day, to check out the bridge I just built or the new flowers that might be growing or how my new decor looks in the daytime. And I look forward to playing with my friends, trading items and design ideas and hitting each other with nets. New Horizons inspires creative self-expression and embraces kindness and friendship, and <em>that</em> is really what makes it such a joy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike in previous games, you're not moving to a lived-in town in New Horizons; the island is completely deserted when you and two animals arrive as part of Tom Nook's \"getaway package,\" save for the tiny airport. There's no store or museum, all three of you live in tents, and Tom Nook himself operates out of a tent that he shares with his adorable nephews, Timmy and Tommy. Tom Nook clearly expected this whole thing to be a bit more glamorous (or at least popular), and in typical Tom Nook fashion, one of his first actions is to put you to work collecting tree branches and fruit to make a fire pit and drinks for a welcome party.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The party serves as an introduction to the resource-gathering aspect of New Horizons' new crafting system, but it's also the first of many endearing moments with the animals. In their high-pitched, sped-up way of talking, they chat about friendship and helping one another on the island. It feels like a proper community from the start, despite the small population size and total lack of amenities on the island.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The first few days are all about establishing the basics of any other Animal Crossing town, like the museum and Timmy and Tommy's store, and this sets the stage for crafting. In addition to catching fish and bugs and picking fruit to make money, you also have to spend a good chunk of time at the start gathering resources to craft the furniture requested of you (and, in one case, to build a whole building). Because I wanted to unlock and upgrade things as quickly as possible, I spent <em>hours</em> each day for the first three or four days running around picking weeds, chopping trees for wood, shaking the same trees for branches, hitting rocks for clay, stone, and iron, and selling whatever I couldn't use to craft for some extra bells.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It was a bit overwhelming to do all that in the name of fast-tracking my island progression, but generally, crafting fits neatly into Animal Crossing's established daily chores loop. The act of gathering resources happens simultaneously with the other things I want to do each day--I shake my trees because two of them per day drop furniture instead of fruit or branches, and the branches I do get are a bonus in my search--and actually makes those tasks more lucrative than they were in previous games. Because of this, I don't really have to go out of my way to get the resources I need to craft the furniture, tools, and other items I want.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

crafting recipes, and you can get new ones in a variety of ways that, like resource-gathering, are a natural extension of the existing Animal Crossing formula. You can buy some of them, find new ones most days washed up on the beach (in message bottles with letters attached, of course), or get them from your neighbors, among other methods. Finding a new recipe is an exciting reward for going about your day, because crafting goes beyond furniture and tools--I've found some surprising and creative recipes using ingredients I didn't expect, like a giant teddy bear you can craft using regular teddy bears you might buy from Timmy and Tommy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Complementing all of this is the Nook Miles program, which is based off of real-life travel rewards points. Nook Miles are a separate currency you can use to buy special items and abilities, like new hairstyles and colors you can switch to at a mirror--you can even use Nook Miles to pay off your first loan and get a real house. You get Nook Miles for doing all sorts of things, from getting stung by a wasp to catching 100 fish in a row without failing once. You can also get Nook Miles for shaking furniture from trees, which, if you're counting, is the second extra reward you can get from doing that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Nook Miles system adds just enough direction if you aren't sure what to do. I've only felt the need to chase the particularly difficult Nook Miles achievements just for completion's sake; I've gotten most of my Nook Miles just by doing Animal Crossing things and having a nice time, and even though I spend some every day, I still have tons to spare.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650794-2020033009461600-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650794\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650794-2020033009461600-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650794\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650794-2020033009461600-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650794-2020033009461600-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3650794-2020033009461600-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">While the day-to-day is rich with things to do, overall progression is a bit slow. It took a frustrating 33 days for Nook's Cranny to upgrade where in previous games it would take around 10. The exact requirements for the upgrade aren't totally clear to me, but it feels unnecessarily time-gated, and the unclear prerequisites exacerbated my impatience. There are also buildings and characters, like Brewster and The Roost, that are totally MIA right now. This may be due, at least in part, to Nintendo's live-service approach to New Horizons, in which certain events and characters come to the game via free updates throughout the year. There's definitely potential for more of the series' cast of characters to appear over time, but currently, it's disappointing that so many of them are absent. It's of course fine to cut characters over time as a franchise evolves, but not having much in the way of grander infrastructure to work towards (whether new or returning) puts a damper on the feeling of building up a town from scratch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the meantime, it's all too easy to absorb yourself in customization and self-expression. This starts with your character. You can actually choose your appearance for the first time in the series, including skin color, and none of the options are locked to gender. In fact, villagers will exclusively refer to players with gender-neutral pronouns--so when a friend visits, your villagers will talk about <em>them</em> instead of him or her. All hairstyles and clothing options are available to anyone, and you can change your face and hair at any time. Dressing up is further improved by a dedicated outfit menu that lets you preview a full outfit rather than switching in and out of clothes until you find something you like. It has never been easier or more enjoyable to express yourself through your character's appearance in an Animal Crossing game, and I've been having a ton of fun trying on goofy outfits and changing my hair to match just because.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3644073\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3644073\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3644073-2020030922080400-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Crafting is, naturally, a big part of customization. You can't craft everything--some kinds of furniture are only available in the shop or found randomly--but there are entire sets of furniture that can only be crafted, and those are largely the pieces that you can further customize with different colors and finishes. At first, I crafted whatever pieces I needed but hadn't been able to buy, like a mirror, but I ended up styling an entire room around furniture I'd crafted and customized. It's that extra bit of flexibility in design that helps inspire creativity and makes each person's home feel unique to them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">More importantly, you can now place furniture pretty much anywhere outside. I found a sand castle in a tree and put it along my beach; later on I got a beach chair and a beach ball and created a whole scene on one part of the shore. I even crafted a cabin-inspired chair I would never put in my house because it fit the woodsy feel I wanted for the hills on my island, which made me realize how much use I could get out of furniture that isn't necessarily my style.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And then there's Island Designer, New Horizons' brand-new terraforming feature. With it, you completely redesign the water features and hills of your island, which lends you an almost intimidating level of creative freedom in your island layout. The tools for waterscaping and cliff construction are a bit tricky to use and master, since it can be hard to gauge where exactly your tool will hit, but it's a powerful creative tool overall. You can also create paths, plazas, flower beds, and more--and it's a huge improvement on the equivalent in past Animal Crossing games, since paths are easy to place and impossible to remove on accident.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650792\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650792\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3650792-2020040110485200-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Animals will even stick to any paths you put down when walking around, which is just one of the little details that makes them more lively and endearing. I often stop what I'm doing to watch a villager do their thing. Animals will drink tea or stargaze or try to catch bugs, and some of them will put on reading glasses to read books at home. You can even run into them at the museum, where they'll comment on the exhibits. Each of these details gives dimension to villagers; I wasn't sure if I liked Stu, for example, until I stumbled upon him singing an adorable song to himself in the middle of town. I watched him for a <em>very</em> long time, and Flurry even walked up and watched him with me. Now they're my two favorites.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Outside of how cute villagers can be, New Horizons is just beautiful to look at. The museum in particular blew me away; the exhibits are incredibly detailed, and walking through each of them genuinely feels like walking through a real museum. The fossil wing, for example, has lines along the floor that seem to chart evolutionary lines for different animals. Following the lines takes you from one display to the next, and at some points, the camera will even pan to get you a better view of whatever's on display.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650793\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3650793\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3650793-2020032215574100-02cb906ea538a35643c1e1484c4b947d.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The cherry on top is sharing all this with friends. My friends and I trade items and tips and give each other spare crafting recipes. I went on a museum date just like one we'd been on in real life a year ago. It's a joy to visit friends' towns and see how they've decorated their islands--each time I visit someone, I leave with a new idea for my own island. And we all send each other letters and gifts in the game because, right now at least, we can't see each other in real life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future.</p>",

Dolores had finally escaped the park for real back in the finale, but what did that actually mean--and, perhaps more importantly, what was she actually trying to accomplish beyond carnage and violence?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The good news is we now have an answer to both of those questions, and they came refreshingly quickly for Westworld. There were no overlapping time-traveling narratives or baffling red herrings to speak of (so far at least), and we can't help but feel like the entire season is off to an incredibly strong start because of it. It's not that there aren't still bigger mysteries at play here--there are plenty, to be sure--but the pervasive sense that the show is more concerned with withholding information to keep Redditors on their toes than it is with telling a compelling story is thankfully nowhere to be found.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 3 dives directly into the fallout of the riots at the park and gives us a look at Dolores' immediate goals--she's aiming to take not just Delos down, but the whole of human society, from the inside out, and using the fact that no one actually knows she escaped (thanks to her clever gambit with a host-clone of Charlotte Hale's body) to her full advantage. Immediately, there's a real sense of just how screwed--and clueless--humanity really is when going up against the hosts. In the Westworld future, mankind is even more dependant on technology than we are in reality and Dolores is able to effortlessly turn just about everything against her first target, from the security of his own house to the woman who may or may not be a host replica of his wife. It's both scary and satisfying, but more importantly, it feels logically sound. Of course, the humans have no fail-safes in place for their tech being turned against them--we've already seen what they think they can do with it and to it through their experiences at the parks, so it's only natural that confidence extends to the real world.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to establishing Dolores' new status quo, the premiere also introduces a brand-new character and, with him, a whole slew of really fascinating world building details. Caleb (Aaron Paul) is a human, ex-military, struggling to get back on his feet after something happened to get him discharged. Now he's working as a construction worker by day and running illicit black market gigs by night. Said gigs come to him by what looks to be an app called \"Rico\" (\"make money motherf****ers,\" it says upon booting up) that provides very Grand Theft Auto-style missions to anyone who's brave (or stupid) enough to accept. The app even has some sort of stat system where criminals can level up the sort of jobs they can accept. Here's hoping we learn more about that soon.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Caleb's introduction also casually introduces the idea of humans having \"implants\" of some sort--Caleb's is apparently turned off, though the option of having it turned back on is there. Apparently, having it reactivated could \"smooth some of the rough edges\" in his life right now, implying that whatever the implants are actually for, there's a behavioral or cognitive function at the very least--but Caleb isn't interested in going down that road. It's an interesting mystery trail head and one that doesn't feel out of place or overly complicated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And then there's Delos proper with Charlotte Hale--or, whoever is inhabiting the host Charlotte now. Like Dolores, no one knows that Hale has been body snatched and three months post the massacre at the park, she's sitting pretty at the head of Delos's chain of command--much to her coworkers apparent chagrin. It's fascinating to watch Hale navigate the corporate side of things, knowing what we know, and it's a welcome change of pace from the Westworld norm. For once, we as the audience are holding more cards than the characters themselves, and the tension that creates feels fresh in context. Whoever is occupying host Hale's body is doing a fantastic job of selling the bit--it certainly doesn't seem like anyone has noticed something is amiss.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That leaves us with Bernard who had one of the more bizarre final turns at the end of Season 2. Why did Dolores bring him back when she knew he was going to try and stop her? That's still yet to be determined, but it seems like the question is haunting him as much as it's haunting us. Bernard has functionally gone into hiding, living a humble life as a farmer, blending in as best he can, and to be certain that he's not being manipulated or controlled the way he has been in the past, he's installed some sort of security subroutine in his systems. This is represented as an eerie sort of self-Q&amp;A session where Bernard accesses his memory and then interrogates himself (\"You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Bernard?\") to see if Dolores has been back to screw around with his reality yet again. It's--well, haunting is probably the best word for it. Poor Bernard has really been through the ringer and it shows. Though his trauma is potentially our gain--there's a good chance this means there won't be any major memory scramble plotlines this season, if we're lucky.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The premiere ends with a bang as Dolores' schemes apparently go up in smoke--though not exactly for the reasons you might assume. Delos security pings Dolores as an identity thief and threat (they're not wrong) but assumes, apparently, that she's still very much human, which leaves her with an unexpected trump card even as she's carted off to be disappeared. It's another fascinating way to emphasize just how completely unprepared the humans are for the threat of the hosts--the idea that there might be a host revolt happening hasn't even pinged their radar at all, even with everything that's happened at the parks. Though that could all be changing very quickly now that Dolores' cover has effectively been blown. This season feels like a powder keg in the best way, and more importantly, feels like it has a clear sense of purpose and identity. It's a totally new direction compared to Seasons 1 and 2, sure, but we can't wait to see where it goes from here.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Also, don't forget to watch through the credits because, uh, what the hell is happening with Maeve?</p><p> </p>",

Building on the original's tough-as-nails reputation, Team Ninja's second samurai action-RPG brings back the original's penchant for punishing and highly nuanced combat. The sequel hones the original's distinctive take on the Souls-like without completely reinventing itself. The result is a long, tough slog that will push even the most challenge-hungry players to their breaking points as they fight for every inch of ground and become master samurai.</p><p>Despite the title, Nioh 2 is a prequel, revealing the secret history of a decades-long period of war in medieval Japan. As the silent, customizable hero Hide, you fight to uncover the secret nature of \"spirit stones,\" which grant supernatural power, and defeat hordes of Yokai across the country. The plot, which you mostly hear through cutscenes and exposition between missions, has an interesting historical bent, but it is really just glue to hold the levels together. Historically relevant names like Nobunaga and Tokugawa play into the saga, but whatever flavor they add in the moment fades the second you take control and it's time to start killing demons.</p><figure data-embed-type=\"gallery\"

Nioh 2's story gives just enough context for you to follow along and make you feel like you're making progress without getting in the way of the gameplay. Nioh 2's definitive feature is its challenge. With core mechanics refined from the bones of Dark Souls, Nioh 2 boils down to a series of battles and duels in all kinds of situations. These battles demand intense precision: Not only are your attacks and skills limited by a stamina meter--called Ki--but any extra attack or mistimed movement will leave you exposed, often to an attack that will cost you a substantial amount of health. Like other Souls-like games, there is a painful pleasure in mastering whatever opponents the game throws your way.</p><p>Nioh 2 builds on the wonderfully diverse range of options for developing a personal fighting style. The original systems return: Each of the nine weapon types offers a unique balance among speed, power, and range, which you can fine-tune on the fly by switching among three stances (low, mid, and high). Each weapon type has its own skill tree and progression, for which you earn points by using it. The core weapon combat remains largely unchanged from the original, beyond some new abilities and two new weapons types, the speedy two-handed Switchglaive and <em>really</em> speedy double-hatchets. That said, the combat is very precise. Nioh 2 demands that you have a profound understanding of all the attacks your weapon(s) can perform, but there's a wide range of attacks and they each put their own spin on how you fight.</p><p>There are also multiple general skill trees, plus character levels that increase your stats based on earning Amrita from killing enemies. Plus, Nioh 2 is a loot game, so you'll constantly be looking at new weapons with tradeoffs that tweak your stats. It's a lot to manage, but it becomes manageable as you find your specialty and focus on upgrading the skills you know you like using.</p><p>For Nioh vets, that's all old hat: Nioh 2's biggest additions revolve around the idea that Hide can channel Yokai spirits. The most important is a hard parry called the Burst Counter, which allows you to counter powerful enemy attacks. Every enemy has at least one attack that's vulnerable to the counter; they're often big, powerful moves that you'll be tempted to dodge. Fighting that urge and throwing yourself at your enemy to turn the tide of battle for a moment is crucial, which makes the combat feel more tactical and aggressive. In the moment when you spot an enemy prepping a burst attack, you feel successful, like you've gotten one over on your opponent, even for a second. Because the game is so difficult, these little victories help drive you forward.</p><p>You also learn Yokai abilities via equippable Soul Cores that allow you to momentarily transform into the enemies you've killed to use one of their attacks. More than Ninjutsu and magic, which return from the original, Soul Cores add a much wider range of contextually useful skills. For example, as the Monkey Yokai Enki, you jump into the air and throw a spear, which is quite novel as Nioh 2 doesn't have a jump button. When the Yokai get bigger--every boss gives you a Soul Core--sometimes a giant head or fist or foot magically appears to maim your enemies. They aren't so powerful that you can lean on them to win a fight, but these skills widely expand the range of things you can potentially do.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\"

super-powerful \"Yokai Shift\" transformation, which temporarily makes you faster and stronger. Triggering the transformation does not obviate the need for tactics. Though you are invulnerable, both using attacks and taking damage reduce the amount of time you have in your stronger form. A failed assault in Yokai mode not only wastes a powerful, slowly charging asset, but may also leave you unexpectedly exposed if you revert to your old self because your opponent caught you off-guard. In true Nioh fashion, even your greatest strength can become a chance for your enemy to get the upper hand.</p><p>It's a lot to learn and, again, you need to get it down perfectly to overcome what Nioh 2 throws at you. You will likely make a lot of mistakes and die many, many times. Sometimes it'll feel like you've hit a brick wall and simply can't win. In those situations, you need to take a deep breath, figure out why you're failing, and adjust your strategy to match. Refusing to change weapons or take risks or otherwise be thoughtful about how you play will leave you frustrated. The more frustrated you get, the more likely you'll lose again.</p><p>Learning your own skillset is just part of the experience. To really excel, you also need to understand Nioh 2's wide world. There's an astounding amount of variety across an extremely long campaign. Its winding, multi-area missions span all kinds of environments, from burning castles and temples, to military camps, to forests and mountainsides. Many of them change radically as you explore them, giving you a great sense of \"travel\" and accomplishment for covering what feels like a long distance. One early level, for example, starts on a hillside outside a castle and ends in a massive underground cave. Even when the levels seem similar--you single-handedly siege four to five castles across 20 campaign missions--varied level design in both pathing and detail make each one feel distinct and worth conquering.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

twisty, turny dungeon crawls. Most have at least one area with a unique trap or environmental conundrum. In one forest level, for instance, a giant owl Yokai patrols certain areas, alerting enemies if it sees you. During a castle siege, you have to dodge artillery fire as you duel enemy soldiers. Also, there are Dark Realm zones, black and white areas haunted by Yokai that provide an even greater challenge by slowing down your Ki regeneration, sprinkled throughout each level. It's only by defeating a specific enemy in a Dark Realm that it will dispel permanently, injecting more ways for you to make progress that doesn't reset when you use a shrine (or die).</p><p>Even for all its variety, Nioh 2 stretches all of its content as much as it can. For every mission in its core campaign, there are two to three side missions, many of which remix a portion of a story mission. On top of that, there are rotating Twilight Missions for high-level players. Plus, upon finishing the campaign, you'll get access to a difficulty level with higher-level enemies and gear. While it can be a little annoying in principle to play the same section of a level three to four times, each version finds little ways to change your path and present new challenges to keep things fresh. If you're interested in wringing absolutely everything out of Nioh 2--master every weapon, get the highest level loot--there are more than enough mission configurations to go through until you've had your fill.</p><p>Likewise, Nioh 2 never seems to run out of new enemies to throw at you. Almost every level has at least one new type of Yokai for you to study and struggle against. They run the gamut, from literal giant spiders to animalistic demon soldiers like the Enki, a giant monkey with a spear, and the harpy-like Ubume. Each enemy has its own range of abilities, and you need to learn everything about them in order to anticipate their attacks and get the upper hand. This process takes time--you won't get it on the first try, or even after the first victory. Every enemy, even the little Gaki demon, which looks like a balding, red-eyed child, can kill you if you aren't bringing your A-game. Dissecting enemy patterns and figuring out how to counter them is the sweetest pleasure Nioh 2 offers: That there are so many enemies with so many different attacks to navigate ensure that the game never loses its flavor.</p><blockquote><p>Even when the levels seem similar--you single-handedly siege four to five castles across 20 campaign missions--varied level design in both pathing and detail make each one feel distinct and worth conquering.</p></blockquote><p>You see this most clearly when you go up against each of the game's extraordinarily difficult boss encounters. Like the levels, the bosses vary widely and are all sights to behold. From a giant snake with mini-snake arms to a three-story spider with a bull's head, each flagship enemy design has a lot of character and is unlike anything you've seen in the game before. They all have one thing in common, though: They're extraordinarily difficult. Even more than standard battles, the bosses effectively demand perfect play for an extended period. You need to be able to recognize every move they make as they make it and know how to respond instantly. Very few took me less than a dozen tries, and many of them took me multiple hours.</p><p>At times, I wondered if maybe some of these bosses should be a little shorter, as there were many bosses where I felt I had mastered their patterns but couldn't finish because they landed a single one-hit-kill late in the fight. Ultimately, that excruciating difficulty and the feeling it evokes are baked into Nioh's DNA, though, and its boss fights remain compelling even as they vex and frustrate. Though it sometimes feels like a curse as you play, it is a testament that Nioh 2 successfully grabs and holds your complete attention so close for so long.</p>",

It's a decent one, too. Solid, even. And, for all that, just a little bit dull. There’s nothing wrong, per se, with an unimaginative adherence to the basic Metroidvania formula, but Mindseize also fails to inspire with its approach to theme-setting and story development. The final result is a competent but unspectacular action-platformer with precious few ideas of its own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You play a father bent on exacting revenge on an evil sci-fi organisation that, uh... seized the mind of his daughter. An early unsuccessful encounter with the Big Bad leaves Angry Dad disabled but, with the help of a good sci-fi organisation, able to continue his crusade by transplanting his own mind into a robot. It's nonsense, of course--though it's inoffensive nonsense, sparing in its narrative dumps and blessedly easy to ignore.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">More urgent matters involve exploring the various planets, each of which is presented as a vast network of 2D platforms appropriated from conventional stock--the jungle area, the industrial factory, the rainy dystopian nightscape, the caves littered with glowing crystals, and the caves that are a bit darker because there are no glowing crystals. They're all there, present and correct, and no more imaginative than similar scenes in countless other games.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

No map markers or giant chevrons pop up to let you know you need to explore the caves more thoroughly before you can progress through the jungle. All you can do is venture into one area, poke and prod your way around until you realise your progress is blocked, then try somewhere else. Chances are the item you need will be there instead. It's rewarding to make these discoveries yourself rather than having them signposted. Recognizing that you’ll have to return to a place later once you’ve collected the wall-jump or the crouch-dash always carries a certain smug satisfaction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On plenty of occasions, however, I felt stuck. I'd pull up the map and stare at it for a while. The map itself is a simple 2D grid with savepoints and vendors pinpointed, different areas colour-coded, and most helpfully of all, thick borders indicating the level boundary contrasted against thin borders that promise more to explore. All the places where the level extended beyond where I'd been were clearly visible, so it was simple enough to backtrack and check things out. Usually, I'd realise I'd missed something the first (or second, or even third) time through: a platform just edging into the screen that I'd wrongly assumed I couldn't reach, a screen that had multiple exits and I'd always taken the obvious one, or maybe a breakable wall that led to a shortcut or a whole new area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When you die you are sent back to the last savepoint you activated--which can be quite some distance apart--and all progress since the savepoint is reset. This creates a tension when exploring an area for the first time, as you weigh whether to double back to preserve your additions to the map against the risk of pressing on and losing it all. I found I got into a rhythm of exploring one way for five to 10 minutes and then ducking back to the nearest savepoint before striking out again to reveal the next little section.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Working to gradually reveal the map's secrets is enjoyable despite the occasional setbacks. The repetition involved in running back and forth, slowly honing the map into shape like a blacksmith tempering steel, isn't merely pleasurable in itself--it also gives ample opportunity to perfect the techniques required to dispatch or avoid all the enemies patrolling the levels.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, while exploring, much of your time in Mindseize is spent swatting aside grunt enemies with an assortment of ranged and melee weapons. New weapons are collected over the course of the game, though you can only equip one of each and can only swap at a savepoint, so there's a nice bit of strategic thinking about which weapons are going to be best suited for the level ahead. There’s not a huge amount of variety in the weapon selection, but each one is distinct enough to necessitate a different approach depending upon which one is currently in your hand.</p><figure

Indeed, it feels more like a conscious attempt to recreate how these games played in the 16- and 32-bit eras, for better and worse. Combat isn’t as fluid and flashy as something like Dead Cells, but there’s a clarity and precision to the weapons and their movesets. As a result, clearing a screen--or just trying to duck and weave your way through--feels like a purposeful series of very deliberate button presses as you perform a neatly choreographed dash, shoot, jump, swing and roll to safety. Under the likely influence of nostalgia, I really enjoyed the simplicity and pixelated chunkiness of the action.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Much of the challenge of traversing a level comes from having to deal with multiple different types of enemies at once, and it's here where the healthy variety comes to the fore. Juggling a screen full of five or six enemies, all trying to kill you in different ways, tests your wits and reflexes even when backtracking. Respawning enemies mean that you start to memorise routes, particularly when heading back towards a boss encounter, and the groove you settle into running through the same handful of rooms again and again is immensely gratifying as it becomes second nature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's unfortunate that the boss battles aren't especially memorable. They're fine, I guess, but they're unremarkable as both combat encounters and as characters. Most bosses rely on a handful of attacks and a gimmick, neither of which feel like they have much connection to the level building up to them. Sure, the last ability you collected is--yep, you guessed it--probably going to prove useful against the next boss, but there's no surprise or invention to it. There's no eureka moment when you realise an unexpected application of one of your abilities. Instead, the boss fights all work pretty much how you'd expect them to, a series of often quite demanding tests of pattern recognition and patience.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I enjoyed wandering the stereotypical video game worlds of Mindseize and dispatching its well-deployed inhabitants. It does enough with encouraging exploration and enemy variety that it kept my mind engaged even if, thanks to the uninspired narrative and character development, my heart just wasn't feeling it. Generic Metroidvanias may be increasingly common these days, but I have to admit that the formula still works.</p>",

            "body": "<p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">When trying to come up with possible reasons why Bloodshot exists, it's difficult not to descend into cynicism. This is a movie that seems designed to cash in on a dubious combination of copy-catting Marvel and DC's successes on the big screen, and <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/vin-diesel\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vin Diesel</a>'s modest star power, which can potentially draw the same crowds who flock to each new Fast and the Furious movie (including us). And Bloodshot isn't a completely worthless imitation--it smartly leaves a lot of the original Valiant comics' cheesy trappings (white skin, red chest, red eyes) in the past where they belong, and it's built on a really fun (albeit moronic) sci-fi conceit that brings with it plenty of cool visual effects and inventive action set pieces.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But those are all things we've seen before at the cinema, and Bloodshot does little to set itself apart from the last 25 years of superhero movies. It's a supremely stupid movie, in the very literal sense that it rarely, if ever, makes any sense--the kind of movie that begs you over and over to simply \"turn off your brain\" and enjoy the machismo spectacle. But idling your brain low enough to \"enjoy Bloodshot for what it is\" might do permanent damage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Vin Diesel's Ray Garrison is a soldier who, when he's not taking out bad guys and rescuing hostages all over the world, savors picturesque romantic getaways with his beautiful wife. Of course, things are actually a lot more complicated than that, but the movie takes a long time to get to its big \"twist.\" In case you want to go into this movie completely blind, I'll mark this as a spoiler--but everything discussed here is explicitly laid out in the trailer: <span data-embed-type=\"spoiler\">Garrison is actually an unknowing operative of a private paramilitary corporation that repeatedly implants him with false memories of his wife being murdered in front of him, then sets him loose on what he thinks are vendettas but are actually assassinations. They wipe him clean every time, tweaking and tuning the fabricated memories and their own performances as they prepare to sell \"weaponized revenge\" to the highest bidder.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">On top of that, they've replaced Garrison's blood with billions of \"nanites,\" microscopic machines that lend him superpowers and can repair any organic damage to his body in a matter of seconds. \"Project Bloodshot,\" as he's dubbed, is like Wolverine on even more steroids; a meathead with a cybernetically enhanced heart of gold. Diesel is, naturally, perfect for the role, and he manages to squeeze in a dimension of vulnerability to the character that makes him likable in spite of everything.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Bloodshot's lengthy opening act as it builds toward the reveal is almost unbearably stupid--and, admittedly, deliberately so. Once it gets there, the idiocy takes on a different tone. Bloodshot cribs liberally from a wide variety of better movies, starting out in the realm of 1992's Van Damme and Lundgren-starring Universal Soldier, before eventually transforming into more of a knock-off MCU by way of later Fast and Furious movies, with a hint of Groundhog Day for good measure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Diesel is surrounded by an able cast doing their best with dopey dialogue and scenarios. <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/eiza-gonzalez\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eiza González</a>, <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/sam-heughan\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sam Heughan</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/alex-hernandez\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Hernandez</a> portray the other members of Garrison's \"squad,\" each with their own, fun cybernetic enhancement. González's character KT, for example, breathes through an aperture installed in the center of her chest, rather than through her trachea and mouth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To give you an idea of how dumb Bloodshot truly is: When, at one point, KT's breathing implant briefly stops working, the character spends a few moments in the aftermath gasping for breath--through her mouth. That's not even mentioning the fact that although the movie <em>could</em> use KT's condition as a thin excuse to explain why she dresses almost exclusively in revealing, skin-tight crop tops, instead it just doesn't even bother.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/guy-pearce\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guy Pearce</a> is the man in charge who orchestrates the whole scheme, although he never really sells his character's villainy. <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/siddharth-dhananjay\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Siddharth Dhananjay</a> (from Amazon's excellent rotoscope-animated Undone) plays the chief developer behind the Bloodshot tech, though he mostly exists to have several jokes made about his apparently small penis, and so he can get one-upped by the superior hacker Wilfred Wigans, played by New Girl's <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/lamorne-morris\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lamorne Morris</a>. Wigans is the source of most of the movie's genuine laughs, and Morris at least seems like he's having fun, even if most of his gags, like trying to speed-eat Chinese food while action scenes happen around him or talking to himself while doing generic hacking stuff, are essentially nonsequiturs that have little to do with the other characters or what's actually going on in the movie.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Most of the characters' motivations are, at best, unclear; at worst, they seem to actively contradict those characters' personalities and/or stated goals. The whole movie operates under the weird conceit that there are no real consequences for anything that happens; this private group is orchestrating hits all over the world, causing large-scale destruction everywhere they go, but there's never any discussion of collateral damage, innocent bystanders, or intervention from any form of government. Granted, that would definitely detract from the fun tone Bloodshot most often goes for, which it does occasionally achieve in isolated moments of blockbuster levity.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642997-eiza.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3642997\" data-ratio=\"0.65764023210832\" data-width=\"1034\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1034px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.8%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642997-eiza.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3642997\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642997-eiza.png\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642997-eiza.png 1034w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/171/1712892/3642997-eiza.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1034px) 100vw, 1034px\" data-width=\"1034\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The nanites themselves provide plenty of fodder for cool visuals and effects. There are even some elements of body horror as Garrison sustains increasingly outlandish wounds, like getting half his face blown off, only for the nanites to swarm there and reconstruct it as we watch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Bloodshot might not be entirely faithful to the original design of the comic book character (and I'm glad that Vin doesn't have a big red circle in the middle of his chest), but there are some nods for fans. The nanites burn neon red when they're doing repairs, causing Garrison's chest to light up like a blood-tinged Iron Man. In one scene, Garrison gets covered in flour, causing him to appear ashy white, which feels perfunctory. Later, once he gains better control of the nanites, his skin turns white as if drained of blood when he's concentrating them on specific tasks, which sometimes involves sending them out of his body entirely. How he continues to walk around when that's happening is as much a mystery as any other choice in this movie, like how nanites that repair your flesh somehow turn you into a walking tank who takes bullets to the chest without so much as flinching.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you're asking these questions--as I did--you've already overthought Bloodshot. If Vin Diesel and a goofy sci-fi/superhero mash-up premise are enough to get your nanites pumping, then by all means, enjoy. Otherwise, Bloodshot will simply leave you cold.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The Hunt is painfully unfunny, and that's the least of its problems. This is political satire at its absolute laziest: utterly reliant on played out stereotypes, totally irrelevant to real current events, seemingly unaware of any actual conversations taking place in the cultural zeitgeist anywhere besides the realm of Facebook memes, and painstakingly, grimly determined to skewer \"both sides\" equally--which is bad enough--and failing to even reach that low bar. The movie is completely dreadful.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The film opens with a simple scene: The camera zooms into a phone screen where the members of a group chat discuss \"our ratf***er-in-chief\" and make references to a mysterious Manor at which they look forward to killing some \"deplorables.\" Cue time jump, and they're airborne, presumably traveling to said Manor, when a groggy southerner stumbles into the main cabin and they're forced to kill him before the festivities even officially begin. Blood spurts from a stab wound in his neck before he gets a stiletto heel to the eye.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, the gore is fun. The Hunt definitely earns its R rating. But beyond that visceral thrill, this movie is truly just baffling. Most of its moderately star-studded cast, including <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/emma-roberts\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emma Roberts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/ike-barinholtz\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ike Barinholtz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/glenn-howerton\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glenn Howerton</a>, and others, appear in just one or two scenes total, leaving little impression before getting gruesomely killed in such inventive ways as \"blown up with a grenade,\" \"shot point-blank,\" and \"arrows.\" The violence remains shocking up to the end, but not the good kind of shocking. With literally one exception, not a single character sticks around long enough to get any development whatsoever, much less a reason for audiences to care at all what happens to them. Each person is simply a meme-spawned stereotype: yoga pants, Florida man, redneck, neckbeard, and, of course, that extends to \"both sides\"--the \"liberals\" are painted as equally quarter-baked clichés.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That lone exception is <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/person/betty-gilpin\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Betty Gilpin</a>, the only character in the entire film who sticks around for more than two scenes. After about half an hour just watching various somewhat recognizable actors getting killed in stupid ways, Gilpin, who viewers might recognize from Netflix's wrestling show G.L.O.W., becomes the clear designated survivor, and the rest of the movie focuses on her. Luckily, the actress is extremely charming, though not enough to salvage this movie--you'd need 100 of her to offset the rest The Hunt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Somehow, inexplicably, The Hunt was co-written by Damon Lindelof--creator of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespots-1-show-of-2019-hbos-watchmen/1100-6472414/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6472414\">HBO's transcendently good Watchmen series</a>--and Nick Cuse, who worked with Lindelof on Watchmen as well as Lindelof's previous HBO series, the also fantastic The Leftovers, and who is the son of Carlton Cuse, with whom Lindelof co-created Lost. When the credits started rolling on The Hunt, it was frankly shocking to see their names on it. If you had told me The Hunt was written algorithmically by Twitter bots scraping political hashtags for image macros, I would have been interested enough to contact Twitter for comment, but not the least bit surprised.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Hunt thinks it's skewering both sides, which would be bad enough. The \"both sides\" argument--as in, there were \"very fine people\" on both sides--discounts the real harm for which one side of this culture war is responsible. It equates people who might be sensitive about racial stereotypes or concerned about the environment to actual Nazis. \"Both sides\" is at best a shaky foundation on which to build a movie, and at worst, the dumbest possible way to frame something that's supposed to be political satire--as in, it's supposed to have something to say.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642996-bg.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3642996\" data-ratio=\"0.50254777070064\" data-width=\"1570\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1570px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642996-bg.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3642996\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/171/1712892/3642996-bg.png\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/171/1712892/3642996-bg.png 1570w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/171/1712892/3642996-bg.png 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/171/1712892/3642996-bg.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">But The Hunt doesn't even do that right, because in the end, it <em>does</em> choose a side. And it shouldn't come as a surprise which side that is, since the movie is literally about one group of people drugging, kidnapping, and murdering another group of people. When one conservative \"victim\" accuses a group of refugees of being \"crisis actors,\" it turns out one of them really <em>is</em> acting. How's that for subtlety?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A final act flashback that adds a bit of context to these events could have been the card turn moment when the movie reveals any tricks it might have had up its sleeves, but it doesn't, because there's nothing there. The Hunt really is as stupid as it can possibly be. Watch it if you're morbidly curious and you like Betty Gilpin, but otherwise, you're better off scrolling down your Twitter feed--and that's saying something.</p>",

Five years later, Moon Studios' followup, <a href=\"/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-465550\">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a>, is every bit as graceful and lovely as its predecessor, even if some of the emotional beats and exploration feel a little less novel the second time around.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Will of the Wisps picks up almost immediately where Blind Forest left off, with Ori's patchwork family unit welcoming a new member, the owlet Ku. The family is happy and loving, but Ku wants to fly and Ori wants to help her. Soon the two are swept off in a gale to a new forest deep with rot, which begins the adventure in earnest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Because this setting is disconnected from the one in Blind Forest, the geography is new, yet familiar. The painterly imagery is comforting, especially in the opening hours as you explore similar biomes. They're beautifully rendered again, but a little samey if you've played the first game. After a while, Will of the Wisps opens up to more varied locales, like an almost pitch-black spider's den or a windswept desert. The theme throughout the story is the encroachment of the Decay, a creeping evil that overtook this neighboring forest after its own magical life tree withered. But if it's meant to be ugly, you wouldn't know it from many of the lush backgrounds--especially in the case of a vibrant underwater section. Ori is often swallowed up by these sweeping environments, emphasizing just how small the little forest spirit is compared to their massive surroundings.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6452399\" data-src=\"/videos/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-boss-and-exploration/2300-6452399/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe   src=\"/videos/embed/6452399/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Ori's suite of acrobatic moves makes delving into new areas a thrilling treat. Exploration becomes especially engaging as you unlock more abilities and become increasingly adept. Some of them are lifted directly from the first game, which can be disappointing next to the excitement of discovering a shiny new ability. Still, those old standbys still work well and make the improvisational leaps and bounds feel as great as ever.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The picturesque vistas seem to be pushing the hardware hard, however. Playing on an Xbox One X, I encountered visual glitches like screen freezes on a semi-regular basis, and the map would stutter. Usually these were a simple nuisance, but once in a while it would come mid-leap and throw off my sense of momentum and direction. A day-one patch significantly reduced the freezing and fixed the map issue altogether.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Ori is ostensibly a metroidvania, Will of the Wisps is less focused on exploration and backtracking than is typical for the genre. Your objectives are usually clear, straight lines, and shortcuts littered throughout the environments get you back to the main path quickly. Most of the wanderlust comes in the form of plentiful sidequests, like delivering a message or finding a knick-knack for a critter. There's even a trading chain. Eventually you open up a hub area that can be built into a small community for the forest denizens. These upgrades are largely cosmetic, so it's mostly a visual showcase of having collected the specialized items used for it. The sidequests are almost entirely optional. I was glad for the freedom to pursue the critical path without artificial barriers, but I also plan to go back and plumb the depths simply to spend more time in the world.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The reduced emphasis on exploration seems to have been replaced by a major expansion of combat. Rather than the passing nuisance of the occasional enemy, Will of the Wisps introduces myriad threats that are a near-constant presence. Thankfully, the combat system has been overhauled to match the elegance of the platforming. The story progress provides a sword and bow, with other optional weapons for purchase, and you can map any combat moves to X, Y, or B. The combat does take some getting used to, though, in part because it's built to work in conjunction with Ori's nimble moves. While I felt awkward and imprecise in combat at the start, slashing my sword wildly at even the mildest of monsters, my comfort level grew as I gained new platforming skills. Around the mid-game I realized I had become adept at stringing together platforming and combat skills, air-dashing and bounding between threats with balletic rhythm and barely touching the ground until the screen had been cleared.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

Will of the Wisps introduces a series of massive boss battles, each more complex than anything in Blind Forest. Their attack patterns are often signaled by barely perceptible tells. Most of the time, the boss fills up a significant portion of the interactable foreground, and even more of the background--but this can make it frustratingly difficult to tell what is and isn't vulnerable to your attacks, or what parts will do crash damage. This all makes defeating them feel like a relief and accomplishment, though sometimes more of the former than the latter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Likewise, tension-filled escape sequences dot the map, requiring almost perfect precision and execution of your tool set to survive a gauntlet of threats. The game offers occasional checkpoints in these sections, as well as a more generous checkpointing feature around the overworld.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The sprawling bosses and climactic escapes are ways to express a larger, more operatic feel for Will of the Wisps. Blind Forest was a humble little game that told an intimate, relatable fable. Wisps has a grander, sweeping scope, and in the process it loses some of that intimacy. It still has moments with emotional heft, both exhilarating and heartbreaking, and Moon Studios still has a way of expressing an incredible degree of wordless emotion with subtle moments of body language.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3642945-3-10-2020_4-21-35_pm-dyk5dmyt.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3642945\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3642945-3-10-2020_4-21-35_pm-dyk5dmyt.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3642945\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3642945-3-10-2020_4-21-35_pm-dyk5dmyt.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3642945-3-10-2020_4-21-35_pm-dyk5dmyt.png 1920w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3642945-3-10-2020_4-21-35_pm-dyk5dmyt.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3642945-3-10-2020_4-21-35_pm-dyk5dmyt.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The story in Will of the Wisps is often darker, and even its touching moments are more bittersweet. The chief antagonist, an owl named Shriek, is similar to the first game's Kuro in having suffered a tragedy in the past. But how the story addresses that tragedy is significantly sadder, and stands as a moment of haunting animation that will stay with me more than any other single image from the game. Even the moments of finality that end the story, while appropriately heroic and hopeful, are tinged with quiet sadness and inevitability--the sense that everything ends.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That finality could signal that this is the last Ori game, a farewell to the fantastical world and memorable characters that made Moon Studios such a standout developer from its very first effort. If that is the case, you could hardly ask for a better send-off. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a remarkable synthesis of artful design and beautiful moments.</p>",
