            "body": "<p>Under a Killing Moon (UAKM) is an excellently wrapped package with some less than compelling contents.</p>  <p>You play Tex Murphy, the bumbling, disheveled detective from two previous Access adventures, Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum. You wander at will through his sharply detailed 3-D environment, examining objects, opening drawers, and talking to characters. Tex's gaming world is huge, ranging from his cluttered office and nearby dark alleys to a glittering mansion and a gargantuan space station. Your goal? Save the world. You'll accomplish this by exploring (high and low), gathering clues and items, solving typical adventure puzzles, and conducting interminable interviews. Experienced adventurers will find that the gaming elements are moderately challenging and if you do run into a brick wall, UAKM has an easy and effective built-in hint system. The game's install process sets a standard for ease-of-use that is thankfully becoming more common.  Problems arise in the acting and dialogue. Both are uniformly stilted. </p>  <p>Access hired some \"name\" actors to lend UAKM some Hollywood cachet, but they have only minor roles and offer less than stellar performances. Most of the acting was done by Access employees&#151;and it shows. Dialogue is more interruptible than interactive since you select questions and listen to responses one at a time. And the storyline, while complex and deep, unravels awkwardly. Nevertheless, the overall experience is entertaining and full of surprises. Access has created a clever story-telling engine; it's the ingredients that need work. A little more time spent on designing a creative story and finding qualified personnel to portray the game's many characters would have gone a long way.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Blizzard Entertainment has outdone itself with this sequel to Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. The development company has become known for highly playable games - including cartridge classics like Interplay's The Lost Vikings and PC greats such as the side-scrolling action game Blackthorne - but the original Warcraft was the first to show Blizzard's penchant for strategic fare. Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness continues in the same vein as its predecessor, but adds more depth and features to the formula.</p>  <p>Combining the best aspects of many strategy favorites - Dune II, Populous and SimCity - Warcraft II manages to create a truly unique experience that considerably improves upon its predecessor. A plethora of options and features have been added to the real-time war game engine of the original, making every aspect of the game, from combat to resource management, much more enthralling. Flying vessels and seafaring crafts have been added, improving upon the landlocked combat of Warcraft. There are new technologies to research, new structures to build, and new races to align with. Resource management has been expanded, and now includes oil, in addition to gold and lumber, as a necessary ingredient for successful construction and destruction. </p>  <p>In addition to noticeably improved artificial intelligence, the most obvious change to combat is the \"fog of war,\" a shroud of semi-darkness which allows your minions to see only what is in their direct line of sight. This decimates any fool-proof strategies that were available in the original; for instance, you can no longer  send a kamikaze scout into enemy territory, then watch the goings-on for the rest of the game. Warcraft II also gives you the option to command nine units at once, making large-scale battles much more viable and enjoyable. And as a complement to the drastic changes in gameplay, the aesthetics have been enhanced too, with highly-detailed SVGA graphics and a bombastic soundtrack that suits the regal mood quite nicely.</p>  <p>Perhaps the most amazing thing about Warcraft II, however, is that it takes two seemingly geek-dominated niches--namely war gaming and fantasy role-playing--and makes them incredibly fun. And funny. There's nothing quite as amusing as hearing one of your minions say, in a faux Shakespearean tenor, \"Why do you keep touching me?\" in the heat of battle. The only slightly justified complaint is that the game is too short as single-player fare. But the incredible multiplayer options (including the ability to have several players use one copy of the CD), coupled with the custom scenario builder and the Beyond the Dark Portal expansion pack, make that nit too insignificant to pick.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Somewhere between an RPG and a wargame, Warhammer offers a refreshing change of pace for fans of either genre looking for a new play experience. Set in the fantasy world of Games Workshop's pen-and-paper roleplaying World of Warhammer, Shadow of the Horned Rat is a compelling adventure that gives you a taste of the life of a mercenary captain.</p>  <p>You start with a small army: a single cavalry and infantry unit. While you peruse a map of the kingdom, the company's accountant and paymaster details the various mercenary jobs currently available and how well each will pay. From here you'll need to select which forces you want to take into battle, and then head out to war. Choose your fights carefully, though; your decisions about whom to support will affect the way the rest of the game is played. As you win more battles, you will gain money, recruit new soldiers, make new friends, and, if you're observant, attain powerful magic items too.</p>  <p>Without overlooking the game's well-written plot and solid voice-acting and animation, it's fair to say that Warhammer's combat system is really its central feature. The game's real-time battles, which are challenging and addictive, require you to observe the land around you and use it tactically. Enemy AI routines are surprisingly realistic and will keep even veteran wargamers on their toes. Unfortunately, the entire combat system is complicated by a movement system that can make it extremely difficult to select your various units.</p>  <p>Warhammer's fantastic character development, addictive warfare system, and absorbing story override most of its interface failings, and most strategy fans will find this title an excellent addition to their game libraries. Be forewarned though: Warhammer is a difficult game, and those with poor tactical skills or little patience will most likely find it too challenging.</p>",

            "body": "<p>There's been an explosion of racing games on the PC of late, many of them amounting to me-too copycat games based on Saturn and PlayStation titles. But this new racing sim from Interplay sets itself apart from the pack with tracks that hearken back to slot-car racing, featuring highly adept opponents, and competitive multi-player action. Even so, the PC has a long way to go in the way of high-speed polygon pushing.</p>  <p>Whiplash does its best to simulate the action of an arcade or next-generation video game system title, but the PC's hodge-podge of parts just can't come up with enough dedicated processing power to smoothly render a game this complex. In VGA mode, the game looks blocky but runs smoothly, but in SVGA even a 100Mhz machine starts leaving out frames when running through Windows 95. There are special startup files made specifically for Windows 95 users, but if you choose these options, your sound setup vanishes. </p>  <p>You have eight cars at your disposal, each rated for abilities including acceleration, top speed, braking, turning, traction, durability and weight. Each of the 16 tracks has a personality which is best suited to a particular car, but any of the car models can win a race on any track. Corkscrews, aerial maneuvers, and full-blown loops are just a sampling of the obstacles you'll encounter on these tracks. While these initially keep the racing interesting, they lose their \"wow\" value after the third lap or so.</p>  <p>My Virtual Pilot Pro flight yoke controller worked great for steering, but I was forced to use the wheel's buttons or the keyboard for acceleration and braking, rather than the wheel's sliding throttle controller. The game would have been more entertaining if Interplay/Gremlin fully supported the few steering wheels/flight yokes that are on the market. Driving via the keyboard does, after all, take most of the realism out of a car sim.</p>  <p>Whiplash's motion and physics are right on the money. Even when it's skipping frames or running  in lower resolution, the game delivers the sensation of driving at high speeds. Excellent sound effects keep you aware of approaching cars and help you know when you're turning too suddenly.</p>  <p>What keeps this game going is the near-flawless racing techniques of the computer-controlled competitors. On the medium skill-level setting you'll rarely finish higher than 13th place. For added strategy, you can race in teams of two, and you can send messages to your computer-controlled or real-life partner such as \"Take out other drivers.\"</p>  <p>Whiplash presents an action/racing game with plenty of choices, opting for fantastical tracks over realism. Smart AI and multi-player capabilities are enough to keep this game afloat for now, but with the proliferation of 3-D accelerator boards, this game will soon be overshadowed by faster-moving, higher-resolution racers.</p>",

From its humble space combat beginnings to the big-budget epic of Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, the popular sci-fi series has stayed on the cutting edge of computer game technology and interactive storytelling. </p>  <p>Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom stays true to the formula of WCIII, alternating interactive movie sequences with Origin's excellent space combat simulator. But WCIV manages to surpass even the excellence of its predecessor. This is due largely to its spellbinding story line, a tale of military corruption and relentless ambition much more complex than the &#147;Us vs. Them&#148; theme of previous Wing Commander games.</p>  <p>The long-standing war between the human Confederation and their arch enemies the Kilrathi has ended, ushering in an unstable era of peace. As Christopher Blair (once again portrayed by Mark Hamill), you must return to active duty to quell a small rebellion. But all is not as it seems, and you'll be constantly questioning your alliances as the true nature of the insurrection is slowly revealed. </p>  <p>The game's interactive movie element has been noticeably improved, with better production and many more paths for the story to follow. The computer generated backgrounds of WCIII have been replaced with physical sets, making the film sequences much more realistic, and your decisions during these movies seem to carry more weight, with a multitude of plot twists and endings.</p>  <p>The space combat is everything Wing Commander fans have come to expect, and there are plenty of options for novices including the ability to make yourself invincible if the battle gets too tough. The varied missions add to the suspense of the story, seamlessly blending the two distinct areas of the game. Wing Commander IV is a great chapter in this excellent series, and will prove an enthralling experience for long-time fans and newcomers alike.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Witchaven is yet another &#147;me too&#148; Doom clone, but this time around, you must use short-range weapons such as swords and battle axes instead of guns and bazookas.  This in-your-face combat is novel at first, but after a few hours of play, you'll be praying for a BFG-9000.  Combat mostly involves running up to a bad guy (preferably while his back is turned) and pressing the trigger button repeatedly.  Long-range attacks take the form of arrows and spells, but they are scarce and should be saved for the really nasty creatures.  </p>  <p>On the positive side, Witchaven attempts to inject a few traditional role-playing elements into the standard Doom mix.  The addition of  spells, equipment damage, and &#147;experience&#148; points is a good concept, but don't be deceived into believing this is anything more than a pure action game.  There is no interaction with NPC's (other than cleaving them in half), and no real plot.</p>  <p>Unlike most clones, Witchaven can be run in a beautiful 640x480 screen mode.  Unfortunately, the frame rate at that resolution drops severely when several enemies appear on screen.  Unless you have at least a Pentium 150, forget all those pretty pictures on the back of the box.  In the standard 320x200 mode, the graphics take on a much more mundane appearance, roughly comparable to Doom's.  A major weakness of Witchaven's graphics lies in the fact that many monsters just look plain stupid.  While some of the more fierce demons, like the dragon, are portrayed well, the run-of-the-mill goblins and ogres would make Ed Wood proud.</p>  <p>Witchaven is certainly not a bad game, but it's not that great either. The graphics and sound are above average, but aren't enough to distinguish it from the rest of the clones available.  If you are looking for a first-person, fantasy-based shooter, I would suggest Hexen from id Software.  If you are looking for a first-person adventure/roleplaying game, try Arena-The Elder Scrolls.  Both provide a much more enriching experience.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Worms is one of those rare games that steps past all of the high profile multimedia fluff and concentrates on delivering what gamers really thirst for - an entertaining play session. Everything about this title, from its &#147;kill everything that moves&#148; concept to its arrow key control, is designed with simplicity and entertainment in mind.</p>  <p>Like the board game Othello, Worms takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master. Players take turns  (up to 16 can play) moving a small worm around a randomly generated landscape and using a nasty weapon set that includes bazookas, shotguns, and fragmentation grenades (my personal favorite). More than just a simple shoot-'em-up, Worms requires players to develop a delicate touch when choosing the best angle and force to fire weapons (this is the lifetime-to-master bit). You'll also have to design complex strategies using the game's non-lethal options&#151;digging tunnels, building girders, and teleporting. The more time players invest in the game, the more subtleties they'll discover&#133; and the more adept they'll become.</p>  <p>Even though Worms isn't the most technologically advanced title, the graphics and sound create a fantastic atmosphere. Rendered cutscenes are humorous enough to keep players interested, and short enough that they're never boring. Sound effects are equally impressive, featuring loads of Lemmings-like speech that makes killing your opponent very satisfying. The end product is a perfect example of how much programmers can achieve with a small budget. This unselfish game will even run on a 386 with 4 megs of RAM.</p>  <p>Worms does have its drawbacks. Since the game is turn-based, a large multi-player game can take what seems like ages to play, and the game's keyboard interface often makes it hard to achieve subtle changes in weapon angle and shot velocity. All in all, though, Worms is an inexpensive game that offers an exciting strategy competition, a lot of laughs, and fantastic replay value.</p>",

A modern classic of strategy war gaming, the original X-COM combined an amazing turn-based battle engine with a complex resource management system to become one of the most addictive and innovative games of the last few years.</p>  <p>Relocating the battle from outer space to inner space, X-COM Terror from the Deep creates a scenario where a long-dormant alien race is awakening from the ocean depths. Once again you must take command of the X-COM troops, leading them through battle and managing ever decreasing funds to improve your facilities. Everything that made the first X-COM such a success is still present in Terror from the Deep, but very little has been added to the formula. </p>  <p>Apart from new art and a handful of new combat options, this is exactly the same game as UFO Defense, only much more difficult. The story follows an identical pattern, ensuring that discoveries and important events are easily predicted by X-COM vets. Even though the &#147;new&#148; alien races and weapon technologies may appear different at first, it gradually becomes apparent that they're the same races and technologies, with new names and new faces.</p>  <p>This rehash leads to some logical errors which are difficult to overcome, especially considering the new aquatic locale. Even though most of the missions take place underwater, you can toss grenades around with ease, and you must develop special suits to allow your soldiers to move vertically (apparently the X-COM training camp doesn't including a swimming class). </p>  <p>Anomalies aside, Terror from the Deep is still a great game, but it seems more like an add-on than a bona-fide sequel. Fans of UFO Defense will find a pleasurable challenge in the cagier alien artificial intelligence, but interested newcomers are likely to find much more pleasure in the original.</p>",

Although this game was released in 1995, it's still my favorite and most-often played disc. What is most immediately noticeable about 'Jack is its frenetic pacing. Much faster and far wittier than television game shows, this game's charm is its simplicity. Instead of concentrating on grinding out the prettiest pixels or the smoothest scrolling, the creators of 'Jack focused on the fundamental building block of good writing. And it paid off, in a BIG way.</p>  <p>While it's akin to TV quiz shows like the ever-popular Jeopardy, YDKJ's clever twist on that genre is its unholy marriage between the likes of Shakespeare and the Sweathogs, Goethe and Gidget, Newton's laws and Fig Newtons. Questions test both classical book-smarts and pop-culture awareness, forcing you to combine these opposing forces and choose a correct answer.</p>  <p>Most startling and rewarding about YDKJ is the sense of realism it creates through its sardonic host, who is never seen but always heard. Two parts Dennis Miller and one part Dennis the Menace, this guy has a line for every situation, and he almost never repeats himself. For instance, if you enter your contestant name as \"John,\" he'll sarcastically reply, \"Your parents sure were creative.\" Little surprises like this, and I won't spoil any more of them, along with a huge stockpile of questions gives this game plenty of longevity. Only after playing it over a hundred times did I notice any repetition--but fear not, Jack-o-philes, an expansion pack of 400 add-on questions is now available.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Despite the elite pedigree that its name suggests, Zork Nemesis has little to do with the best-selling, text-based Zork of a simpler era.</p>  <p>That said, expect the folks at Activision, Inc. to walk around their West Los Angeles offices with a classic \"What, me worry?&#148; grin. As soon as Zork Nemesis deposits players into its temple courtyard, the Myst crowd will feel right at home, and Activision should keep on smiling all the way to the bank.</p>  <p>Myst, which has stayed on top of the sales charts since it was released in September 1993, put the final nails into the text-adventure coffin. It's ironic, then, that this new adventure-exploration CD-ROM should attack its family tormentor by taking the graphic adventure genre to a new level.</p>  <p>This title's richly-executed visual environment, well-written plot, \"Z-Vision\" 360-degree pivoting point of view, Gregorian chant soundtrack, and ambient sound effects (Windows 95 only) make for a slick, enticing game experience--but computer gamers should expect that experience to be a long one.</p>  <p>While Zork Nemesis follows the search-for-goodies-that-will-get-you-out-of-trouble format, the game's designers trip players up by throwing in many situations that demand abstract, sometimes counterintuitive reasoning. If players can get past these frustrating moments and concentrate on what decisions fit best within the Zork Nemesis underworld, they'll be rewarded with a progression of puzzles more closely tied to the story than is the case with The 11th Hour or Phantasmagoria.</p>  <p>In between decision points, Zork Nemesis presents some of the best integration of full motion video to date. Why? The use of such footage is restrained and understated. There's a lot of it throughout this three-disc adventure, but it's always supportive of the 3-D rendered environment and the story.</p>  <p>Lately there has been a clarion's call for multidimensional characters and situations in computer games, and Zork Nemesis actually delivers the goods. As players uncover more information, they come to realize that there are reasons why the chief villain has set events in motion. Players may even become sympathetic. Other characters are just as complex, and assuming that an ally can be trusted can lead to dead ends.</p>  <p>While Zork Nemesis may be too graphic and intense for children, adults who loved Myst or Phantasmagoria will find a lot to like about this CD-ROM. With Broderbund Software pushing the sequel to Myst back into 1997, computer gamers might not find a better substitute than Zork Nemesis.</p>",

Hard-core gamers who like the 3-D action of Dark Forces may scoff at the game's limited options. Likewise, veteran joystick jockeys will laugh at the fake flying, which follows a predetermined line and doesn't provide the kind of control you get in Origin's Wing Commander series.</p>  <p>Rebel Assault II's fine musical score, well-written script, and decent acting will be enough to satisfy those seeking a worthwhile multimedia \"experience,\" but the limited gameplay will most likely send hard-core gamers running back to Tie Fighter.</p>",

After defeating Coton in the first installment of Rise of the Robots, she (the Supervisor takes a female form) destroyed his body and kept his mind alive, integrating his essence into her neuralnet as a tutor for her subservient droids. Once they realized that Coton had failed, the scientists hatched another plan to overcome the Supervisor. They introduced an A-virus, or Anarchy virus, into the neural net that all the Supervisor's robots were plugged into. Now the virus has reached Coton's conciousness and he has formed an escape plan. Download his knowledge and abilities into one of the subordinate robots and battle his way out. </p>  <p>Rise 2's beautiful graphics and entrancing techno soundtrack are impressive, to say the least. Backgrounds are colorful and well-implemented; the music and sound effects are strong and vibrant, and work well together to create an exciting play atmosphere. You can choose from a large number of great-looking robots&#151;some are big and strong, while others are small and quick, and each has special moves that only it can perform. One particularly nice feature is that you can get extra projectile moves by performing a termination move on your defeated opponent.  </p>  <p>But none of this means anything if the game isn't fun. And unfortunately for us, Rise 2 isn't. The moves feel awkward and clumsy, and if you don't use the keyboard, a six-button controller, or Gravis Grip Adapter, you won't be able to perform all of them anyway. If you're looking for easy-to-perform moves and reliable functions, try out Mortal Kombat 3, One Must Fall 2097, or FX Fighter.

            "body": "<p>Drake Edgewater - the vigilante cabbie from 1995's Quarantine - is back behind the wheel of his hover-cab in GameTek's Road Warrior, a violent kill-spree that explores the many meanings of the term \"hack.\" </p>  <p>The aforementioned Quarantine was an interesting attempt at a 3-D shooter, a hybrid of Doom and Death Race 2000 in which you drove around destroying vehicles in your way and running over pesky pedestrians. A pleasing setting, to be sure, but Quarantine suffered from several problems, the most apparent of which was an unrelenting control scheme that made stopping your vehicle nearly impossible. Road Warrior tries to address its predecessor's most frustrating shortcomings, but in doing so it eliminates some of the features that made Quarantine special in the first place. Most notably, the addictive \"vigilante for hire\" element has been removed. In the first game, you had to earn money for weapons upgrades and repairs by picking up fares around Kemo City. In this sequel, you're  simply sent on a series of assignments, and your cab is repaired and your ammo replenished upon completion. Another improvement allows you to brake more easily, but the movement of the game never feels realistic. Your cab still bounces around like a hockey puck whenever you get sideswiped, and getting stuck to scenery is an all too common occurrence. </p>  <p>Road Warrior does add some positive features. The original's simplistic story art has been replaced by excellent comic-book style cut scenes. A new option allows you to view your cab from behind, making it easier to maneuver through the maze-like streets, and an SVGA mode allows for smoother art on more powerful machines. And, in all fairness, the mission-based levels do give the game a bit more focus, eliminating the endless schlepping around of psychotic citizens. </p>  <p>For all its merits, however, this sequel to Quarantine doesn't have the horsepower to keep up with the next generation of 3D shooters. As a crash-course in offensive driving, Road Warrior provides some mindless fun, but is only a slight improvement over its flawed predecessor.</p>",

            "body": "<p>As computer games become more advanced, and consumers more sophisticated, the trend has been toward higher extended play value through immersive, painstakingly realistic simulation. These days, comprehensive statistics and piles of information to digest seem to be the only way to Get Your Money's Worth.</p>  <p>In response, the makers of this hot racing title simply say &#147;Let's race!&#148; Screamer shuns the pit stops, personnel moves, and car equipment upgrades that have become familiar to racing fans in favor of colorful, straightforward, hard-driving action. I, for one, am happy to see it. All you need to do is choose your car, choose your track, and hit the gas.</p>  <p>All this fun is not without its weak points. The graphics are good (despite the lack of apparent car damage and some polygon cutout in the tunnels), but the game slows noticeably in SVGA mode, where it looks best. In addition, the manual transmission cars perform noticeably better than the automatics, requiring you to master the more complicated driving style to succeed. Not a huge problem, but it's ironic considering that the game prides itself on its simplicity. </p>  <p>So where's the extended play value? It's in the variety of courses and it's in the four modes of play: the championship mode, the time trial mode, the cone mode (where hitting cones adds seconds to your time), and the slalom mode, where you have to drive between gates to add time. Each of these can be played on three difficulty levels.</p>  <p>But none of this is the point of this game. Screamer is for people who don't have five hours to spend analyzing which struts perform best in the snow on mountain terrain. They've got ten minutes, they're on the run, and they want a race. Whether it's against the computer or up to seven networked friends, a race is exactly what they're going to get.</p>",

It seems you've been dared to spend the night in the dilapidated old museum, which was never open to the public due to a bizarre incident that took place many years ago. Two teenagers and the professor himself disappeared under unknown circumstances, and you must solve the mystery if you're to survive until dawn.</p>  <p>Basically, your task is to collect a series of mischievous spirits, or Ixupi, which have been unleashed from the urns which held them. The urns and their accompanying lids are scattered throughout the grounds, and you must find the correct lid/urn combination to capture the corresponding Ixupi. Finding these objects is made more difficult by the fact that the professor was an eccentric who filled his museum with plenty of puzzles and secret passages.</p>  <p>These puzzles aren't particularly challenging, and many of them must be repeated every time you need access to an adjoining area. (This occurs all too frequently, since you can only carry one object at a time.) Fortunately, wandering around the museum is, at least for a while, an interesting experience. The displays are eerie and fascinating, and the mystery surrounding the museum is unveiled through the personal belongings of the missing persons. Unfortunately, once you've seen all there is to see, traipsing back and forth searching for objects you've already found becomes a repetitive chore, and the game loses some of its allure. In the end, Shivers is a game that has a look and feel guaranteed to get your attention, but may lack the depth of play to keep it for the long run.</p>",

(Silent Thunder also has one of the shortest, meanest cinematic intros you are likely to see in a Sierra title.)  Employing Dynamix' Terrain and 3DSpace technologies, Silent Thunder sports astoundingly smooth, photo-realistic, texture-mapped terrain and structures which are among the finest I've seen outside of location-based flight sims.  The challenging continuity of campaign games can be found here as well, and the redbook audio soundtrack is well worth the extra install space required.  The brutish, lethal A-10 has captured the attention of the computer war-gaming public in recent years, and if you're part of that public, Silent Thunder is the game you want to check out.",

The original SimCity gave players the opportunity to create and oversee the growth of a living city as well as all its problems: crime, pollution, zoning demands, power outages, traffic foul-ups, and the occasional tornado, nuclear meltdown, or wandering monster from the sea. Less a &#147;game&#148; in the usual sense of the word than a sort of electronic ant farm, SimCity let players see how they fared as mayor, architect and town council.  Now SimCity 2000 adds adjustable topography to the fun, using a terrain editor which can create mountains, valleys, ravines, etc. (The new types of terrain also permit the construction of hydroelectric dams and water towers.) Necessitated by this new addition is a new viewing engine, which rotates the player's municipality in 90 degree increments, so that new mountaintop university doesn't block your view of the burgeoning slum down below.  As the town progresses through the decades, the sheer size and technological sophistication of your creations become more and more outlandish, and the resultant metropolis ends up looking like something out of Blade Runner.  It can take quite a while to become familiar with Maxis' Sim series, and even longer to actually succeed at long-term city goals. Once you get beyond the learning curve, however, the cycle of planning, construction and urban renewal leads to a rewarding creation.  And, as always, hard-won cities from earlier versions of the game can be imported for alteration and experimentation.",

Humanity cuts them down for paper so we may record our emptiness.&#148;                 -a quote from Kahlil Gibran, on page one of SimIsle's 100-page paper manual.</p>  <p>The cynic would say that SimIsle represents Maxis' effort to make up for creating a generation of developers, polluters and high-risers with their excellent and incredibly popular SimCity series of games. I say that after SimFarm, SimTower and SimAnt, they have simply run out of places to develop. Whatever the case, Maxis has come out with a new sim that manages to keep most of what was good about the other titles, and incorporate just enough change to create a new challenge for all of the SimAddicts out there.</p>  <p>The big change in SimIsle, aside from its heavy-duty, protect-the-rainforest theme, is that it's more like a role-playing game than its predecessors. Where SimCity allowed you total freedom in initial creation and then forced you to face the consequences, SimIsle is more concerned with having you think of your actions as a means to an end. Each new island presents a different challenge&#151;say, building a tourist industry or developing local cultures&#151;and you must utilize your agents' special skills to achieve these goals within a preset time period (although you can play in FreeForm mode, with no limits). As in a RPG, your actions are restricted to those that will help you on your way, and everything you do serves as a stepping stone to success. If you cut more trees, you can build more hotels; more hotels mean more tourists, more tourists mean more cash, etc.</p>  <p>The graphics keep the same colorful, busy feel as earlier Maxis titles, with little planes and trucks zooming around the island. Multimedia film clips and sound effects are included but are, for the most part, repetitive and extraneous. One exception is the game's soundtrack, which ranges from tribal chants to metal rock with no apparent rhyme or reason.   </p>  <p>In general, SimIsle won't disappoint the high expectations of hardened SimFans. It may not be the best of the bunch, but, if you can handle the sick feeling you get when the first high-rise goes up on a previously unspoiled island, your free time will soon be the endangered species.</p>",

As a CIA operative from &#147;The Farm,&#148; the player must utilize intelligence records and techniques--including satellite photo enhancement, multi-level data analysis, field combat training, image alteration and even interrogation/torture--to root out a group of renegade secret agents who have killed a Russian presidential hopeful and are now after America's Chief Exec.  My head's had just about all the bad-acting-intensive, video-based yawners it can handle without actually imploding, so Spycraft came as something of a relief. The acting is reasonably good, and the game elements are presented in a nonlinear fashion which, while simplified (and still slightly bewildering), presents the realistic, on-your-own flavor of an intelligence operation.   This is not a game whose video segments are mere story-props that leave the player behind, but one designed to keep the player actively involved (sometimes emotionally involved, and that's all this reviewer is gonna give away about that).   </p>    <p>Spycraft is a classy piece of work; it's entertaining but at the same time manages never to insult the player's intelligence, unless it's on purpose (&#147;Absolute crap!&#148; is one of the charming evaluations your handiwork may receive over the course of your training.)  A caveat:  Realism, acting and game quality aside, Spycraft is essentially a mystery, and hence has as much replay value as finding your car in a mall parking lot.</p>",

As the smart cursor moves around the screen (a static digitized photo), it changes to various icons that let you Look, Take, and Use objects, as well as Talk to the tough thugs, sultry sirens, and other stereotypical characters you'd expect in a 1940's detective story. Thankfully, it's a long way from the &#147;visit a witness, record a video&#148; gameplay of ICOM's Sherlock Holmes games, or the mind-numbing videotape work in Voyeur.</p>  <p>You play as a second-rate private dick named Scott Anger, who's just come off a month-long bender sparked by the drive-by shooting death of his fiancee. Your first assignment back at the office seems simple enough: a missing-persons case notable mostly for how much you're attracted to your client, the curvy Carol Klein. But after a couple of days of sleuthing (and perhaps even petty larceny and breaking and entering), you learn that a whole series of major crimes--bank robbery, arson, and murder--are somehow linked to your case. And when some unsavory characters suspect you know the location of some stolen diamonds,  your life--and the life of your girlfriend--hangs in the balance.</p>  <p>Because the puzzles can be complex and the clues sometimes vague, you'll want to save often, which brings us to the game's biggest weakness: There are only five save-game slots, a pitifully small number for a game this long and complex. To make matters worse, there's no way to call up the Save/Load menu--you've got to journey back to Anger's office every time. It sounds trivial, but after you've done it several times you'll realize just how much this slows down the action (even if you hit ESC to bypass the video clip of Anger tossing his hat on the coat rack).</p>  <p>Even so, murder mystery fans will find enough here to enjoy that they'll probably be able to look past the flaws, and veteran gamers won't feel cheated by blowing through the game in a few hours. If you're looking for a truly interactive video-based adventure, this could well be the ticket.</p>",

Looking beyond the tired low-res character animations, the limited use of colors, and the conservatively drawn backgrounds, this adventure game follows the explorations of three overtly stereotypical characters through unimaginative, predictable plot twists, completely devoid of the humor that you'd expect from a LucasArts game and the humanity that you'd expect from a Spielberg production.</p>  <p>There's no \"magic\" here. As you simply guide a stock hero around an uninhabited planet, the only sparks of excitement are quickly counter-balanced by inordinately difficult puzzles. Not only are these brain-twisters tough, but they're temperamental&#151;some follow logic, others  just call for trial and error, and yet others will leave you clueless, even if you've attempted to cheat your way through. </p>  <p>Mr. Card's dialogue is no less deplorable than the game's slow-paced plot. The voice-acting is believable, but again, stereotypical. All this aside, though, what securely affixes this title to the bottom of the LucasArts list is how seriously it takes itself. In games like Full Throttle and Day of The Tentacle, where comedy is king, inconsistencies and stereotypes can be overlooked as part of the silliness. But the epic space adventure drama of The Dig doesn't have this freedom, and it doesn't pass the litmus tests of believability or entertainment.</p>  <p>The Dig's saving grace is its grand music score in a Wagnerian vein. If only the rest of the game echoed the quality that its sound scheme does, then it might be worth playing. </p>  <p>Better to leave this one buried.</p>",

Sleepless nights and raves around the water cooler became the sign of the hopeless Doom addict.</p>  <p>And the way the game was sold&#151;we played the first episode free, then registered to pay for the chilling conclusion&#151;proved that companies didn't need million-dollar marketing campaigns. Since then, many games have used this technique, from the popular puzzler Zoop to the robo-combat-flier Descent.</p>  <p>Even now, The Ultimate Doom remains ultimately playable, thanks in large part to the original design that allowed hackers to program their own levels. Doom isn't just a game, it's an environment. I can remember talking with a gearhead buddy of mine, discussing the use of the Doom engine as an operating environment for the office. &#147;Yeah, I've got those third-quarter figures for you in an Excel spreadsheet,&#148; you might e-mail a colleague. &#147;You'll find it in the basement, next to the Baron of Hell.

Featuring a fresh new look as well as a new set of monsters, items, and locations, the company has managed to produce a title that's just right for adventurers who seek something a bit different.</p>  <p>A pleasing combination of the open travel of Ultima Underworld and the quick combat of Lands of Lore, Thunderscape's new interface gives players full freedom of motion in a 3-D world, without making them spend more time learning how to control the game than they do playing it. The intuitive mouse controls will have players zipping through the dark caverns in no time, taking on the worst enemies the nocturnals have to offer.</p>  <p>Once the game drops into combat mode, S.S.I.'s versatile new play engine really shines. Each turn, players can choose between the standard combat actions of strike, defend, or retreat, and select from a host of new options including aimed shots, feints, shield bashes, berserking, and many others. The overall effect is to give players as many ways as possible to do exactly what they want to do in  battle. Even after several hours  spent fighting your way through a maze, the combat system never gets frustrating, thanks to its almost-perfect blend of freedom with ease of use and speed.</p>  <p>Thunderscape creates a vivid new world for players to explore by blending solid 3-D animation with great still-screen art and a passable soundtrack. Using a fast-moving story, scores of new character races that include faery-folk, half-man half-animal mutants, goblins, and lizard-people, along with new magic and scores of new skills, Thunderscape provides an RPG experience that is solid entertainment. Recommended to any serious RPG fan.</p>",

            "body": "<p>TIE Fighter is the best space combat game ever made. Having said that, I know I face the wrath of Wing Commander fans everywhere.  Too bad, because while Wing Commander has always been a fantastic game, TIE Fighter and its noteworthy predecessor, X-Wing, offer a little more.  Not only does their flight modeling \"feel\" better, but they benefit from drawing on George Lucas's Star Wars universe, which over the years has become ingrained in the American psyche.</p>  <p>The original TIE Fighter put you into the cockpit of one of Darth Vader's fighter ships, those nasty, nimble pests that gave you so much trouble in X-Wing. There's a diverse mix of spacecraft available, which helps keep mission diversity pretty high, since each has its own strengths and weaknesses. </p>  <p>The latest incarnation of TIE Fighter is the Collector's CD-ROM, which gives the game a needed facelift and brings the total number of available missions to over 100.  Furthermore, graphics resolution now goes as high as 640x480 in high-res mode for combat sequences.  This, coupled with the addition of small details like rotating turrets and more sophisticated shading, lends TIE an even more impressive look.  The new missions run the gamut from tricky escorts to strikes, to other battles that  draw on the full range of TIE spacecraft.</p>  <p>With such a rich selection of ships and missions, chock-full of scorching action, TIE Fighter is an easy game to get hooked on.  It can get pretty tough in some of those later missions, but don't worry&#151;you can handle it.  After all, you're working for the Dark Side.</p>",

For these hard-core hookers, every waking moment is spent fishing, talking about fishing or thinking about fishing. Well, now they can add simulating fishing to the list. After all, variety is the spice of life.</p>  <p>Trophy Bass is a true simulation, mixing actual bass fishing with an extensive tutorial which can help both on the screen and on the pond. You're also armed with a guide who gives you little tidbits of bass fishing lore throughout the game. You can choose from different lures, casts, rods and lines to try on the wide variety of lakes and water types.</p>  <p>As wonderfully comprehensive and engaging as Trophy Bass is for the avid fisherman, it can be somewhat tedious for the average player. Just as with real fishing, much of your time is spent trying new lures, different casts, and obscure locations in an attempt to get a lunker to make his move. Some people enjoy this sort of thing; others don't.</p>  <p>The simulated fishing itself is actually a bit easier than the real thing. Place an aiming target right on the spot where you want to cast; the weeds and snags are merely decorative, letting you reel right over them. Once the fish follows, it usually bites, and, with the right test line, you'll usually land it. In this game, even the novice has some fish tales to tell. While this &#147;beginner's luck&#148; makes Trophy Bass much more fun at first, it also undermines the game's extended play value. This is partially remedied by the inclusion of tournaments and careers, which give you a reason to keep on fishing even after you've mastered the basic skills.</p>  <p>If you're at all interested in the concept, you'll find Trophy Bass well-made and fun to play. If not, cast your line elsewhere.</p>",

Review a game which sends you on a hopeless mission into tedium and annoyance. Equipped only with an unresponsive control system, explore the increasingly complex mazes while battling the same life forms over and over. Irritated. Bored. Unlock the mystery inside the crystals, then use the passwords contained therein to assure that you never have to face the shell maze ever again.</p>  <p>Promoted as the thinking person's Doom clone, Ice and Fire thrusts you into one maze world after another, forcing you to battle alien enemies as you explore each level, looking to free your cryogenically frozen compatriots. Unfortunately, the result, as it is with so many maze games, is that you finish all the action and are left looking around for that one last key that will get you to the next level--which you can't seem to find. Level access is controlled by passwords found on earlier levels, so, until you find them, you are stuck.</p>  <p>All of these maze levels are contained in the larger framework of...another maze! This maze, ostensibly on the outer surface of an asteroid, forces you to make split-second directional choices while flying and battling enemies. Thankfully, a map can be transposed over the screen (in all levels) to give you some idea of where you are. Regretfully, the controls in the larger maze are so unresponsive that, even when you know where you want to go, it's a real challenge to get there.</p>  <p>The graphics are strong, most notably in the insert sequences where you reload and power-up your ship. The game is incredibly challenging, and puzzle/maze buffs will be in absolute heaven. If you are looking for action, though, you will likely find the enemies more repetitive than challenging. This game tests patience and logic, and Doom fans will find the only similarities here are the first-person perspective and the letter \"D\" in the name.

The objective of the game is simple -- eliminate all the pyramids on each level &#150;but with pyramids like Seekers and Immobile Dudes, what at first glance seems to be easy, quickly becomes a \"triangliophobe's\" worst nightmare. </p>  <p>Graphics are extremely bright and presented in slick 3D format.  It's easy to differentiate between all the different colored pyramids and their functions.  Control is equally pleasant, but has its share of anomalies. Although you can use the mouse to move around, the arrow keys, in the end, offer more control.  Shooting diagonally seems easy, but some of the pyramids are slightly out of line so you can't take out an entire row by simply firing to your heart's content. As for the sound, most of the tracks are upbeat but if you do get tired of a certain one you can omit it through the option feature.  Believe me, if you play a level enough times, you'll want to change the music.</p>  <p>Put away any silly notions of quickly defeating this game. Even though Icebreaker offers a plethora of levels and a wide range of skill settings, the game is pretty tough to master. A few rounds set on \"Easy\" or \"Medium\" will boost your confidence and minimize your fear of rabid polygons, but the &#147;Hard&#148; level is just that, and the ultimate challenge, &#147;Insane&#148; is only for the bold and brazen. After a few tries of shooting Seekers with your plasma blaster as they mercilessly converge on you, you'll be set for the funnyfarm.  </p>  <p>Be sure to keep your eyes open for those Seekers while avoiding certain Immobile Dudes.  Don't let their name lull you into a sense of security.  Some Dudes are just as deadly as the Yeller and Cyanide Seekers. Run into a Red Dude and watch your pyramid soul float off the screen.  Nothing to do but try the level again (perhaps for the hundredth time) or simply admit defeat to a bunch of pyramids.  Take what's behind door number one and play the level again, you'll conquer it - eventually.  After all, they're only pyramids.  Pyramids with minds of their own. </p>  <p>Playing Icebreaker will give you many tortuous but delightful hours of entertainment as you try to rid the world of those evil pyramids.</p>",

Computer gaming, and the graphic adventure genre in particular, may be in serious need of innovation, but this run-of-the-mill adventure doesn't provide it. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is replete with all of the shortcomings of its genre. There are numerous dead ends and illogical puzzles&#151;for example, you must flush a toilet three times to access a hidden room. There are also many programming bugs; characters will walk backwards across the screen and even vanish without warning. </p>  <p>To be fair, I Have No Mouth&#133; does experiment with some interesting concepts, and the dark tone of the original short story is maintained with bleak artwork and depressing situations. But the so-called &#147;ethical decisions&#148; these five imprisoned souls must face are no more than red herrings, providing only stopping blocks to progress or disturbing scenes with no tangible purpose. More disturbing is Ellison as the voice of AM (the evil supercomputer which has imprisoned the five protagonists), which may as well be renamed HAM after his over-enthusiastic performance. </p>  <p>Die-hard adventurers will certainly find a challenge (especially during the incomprehensible end-game) and Ellison aficionados may be intrigued by this extension of his work, but I Have No Mouth&#133; doesn't prove to be a worthy translation of the sci-fi classic. Instead, this title relies on the frustrating cliches and roadblocks that have plagued the adventure game genre since its inception.</p>",

Instead, the creators of this interactive, story-intensive drama used their resources wisely, developing a good, solid script and thoughtfully crafting the interaction to create a sense of realism unrivaled in this genre.</p>  <p>Because of the distinct process that an attorney must follow when doing his workquestioning witnesses, establishing motives, and linking evidence&#151;crime-solving is well-suited for simulation through a logical cause-and-effect structure like the one used in this game. In The First Degree quickly teaches you how to think like a criminal prosecutor. In no time you'll be analyzing various characters' motives, and asking the right questions to make your witnesses reveal just enough information to incriminate the bad guys.</p>  <p>The case that you've been assigned centers on the murder of an influential San Francisco artist, and involves his community of family and friends. The game has two major parts: first, a pre-trial interviews segment, and then the trial itself. Ask the right questions of the witnesses in the pre-trial section without alienating or exhausting them, and there's a better chance they'll respond similarly in court.</p>  <p>The interface takes the form of basic dialogue selection in which you choose from a list of questions or comments. Unlike other games, In the First Degree won't deliver a desirable outcome if you just click liberally through the different lines of dialogue. In this title, you must size up your witness and make decisions based on character, tolerance, and other human traits. By adopting a more sophisticated structure, the game admirably simulates actual conversation and personal interaction, and adds a decidedly emotional slant. The writing is top-notch, the acting is consistently strong, and the result is a very realistic&#151;albeit dramatic&#151;experience.</p>  <p>Playing this game  is more like reading a good courtroom drama novel than matching wits with mind-bending graphic adventures; this originality and accessibility are what make In The First Degree a murderously good time.</p>",

Or, you can move up north to play a round at Banff Springs, set in the Canadian Rockies. Other courses (18 in all) range from Access Software's home course in Bountiful, Utah, to the famous Pebble Beach. About the only big course missing is the Masters&#151;in your dreams, pal.</p>  <p>Three skill levels and the same number of tee positions (on most courses) make it possible for players of varied experience to play together. The animated golfers can be either male or female, which is a nice touch.</p>  <p>The game doesn't have modem or network features; however, you can save your game in a &#147;player file&#148; then send it to a friend who can play against you. Trading files is a simple if clumsy way of holding tournaments. You can also save favorite shots, get instant replays, and practice any hole on any course.</p>  <p>If you're looking for variations, such as Skins or Sandies, look elsewhere.

The terrain and buildings in this battle-mech sim are presented courtesy of the Sierra/Dynamix' 3DSpace engine, and look just as good as the much-hailed Silent Thunder which uses the same scheme.   With graphics quite a bit cleaner than those in, say, MechWarrior 2,  ES2's 50-plus missions are just that crucial bit more challenging, and the addition of an air-capable HERC called the \"A-10\" - er, ahem, I mean the \"Razor,\" - makes the overall combat action all the more hectic. Like in the first game, players can outfit and customize their HERC units between battles, and those missions involving Razor air strikes are tantamount to pretty decent little flight sims in their own right.

Now Activision has brought that same fast-paced, side-scrolling action game to the PC with more levels, more weapons, and a chance to trick-out your work area with a Jim desktop theme that plugs into Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. </p>  <p>Like The Simpsons, this animated character traverses the terrain between slapstick humor and social commentary&#151;you could even call it subversive. With the same mastery that ported Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure from a cartridge game to a PC game, Activision has done justice to Jim with a righteous conversion.</p>  <p>The keyboard serves as a decent controller for this side-scrolling game, but to skillfully dodge and shoot the biggest bosses you'll want to play this one with a gamepad. The game is Windows 95 native, so it integrates smoothly into your desktop and there's no installation.

In EF2000 you take command of the futuristic Eurofighter 2000, which won't see action until its inception into the Royal Air Force in the year 2000.  With three different modes of play (training, campaign, and quickstart) and a random mission generator in its campaign mode, it offers variety and replay value not found in other simulators.  </p>  <p>The graphics in EF2000 are sharp and richly detailed.  Cities actually look like cities, and the natural scenery is smooth and textured.  The impressive CD-quality music gets you in the mood to shower the enemy with your 27mm cannon.   </p>  <p>Control can be jumpy on slower machines, but if the detail levels are adjusted, EF2000 moves smoothly enough to be enjoyable; on a Pentium 133, the game handles so well you'll bob your head when rolling.  Other goodies include the ability to compete against seven other players and an option to listen to your own CD music while flying.</p>  <p>This title's only problems are minor and deal mainly with its steep learning curve.  It is essential that you read the entire manual and memorize a number of keys before you'll be ready to fly a real mission, which adds to the realism of the experience.  </p>  <p>Overall, EF2000 is a solid and overwhelmingly satisfying combat simulator.  Not only do you get the chance to fly a futuristic battle plane before the real pilots do, but you also have beautiful scenery to view while you zoom to combat areas.   If you have the time and patience to learn EF2000, you won't be disappointed.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Despite the wordy description above, Endorfun is a very simple puzzle game. You roll a cube around a board made of blank squares and try to land on the board's one pulsating, colored square&#151;with the matching color on your cube facing upwards. This concept alone makes for a challenging, if repetitive game; but the title's New Age graphics and messages make  Endorfun far more interesting fare.</p>  <p>Best described as an interactive Fruitopia commercial, Endorfun's puzzle game is set against a background of pulsating, shimmering, moving, colorful patterns. The colors animate to the hypnotic rhythm of jazzy World Beat and New Age music performed by The O Band, a collection of artists led by Nigerian master drummer, Onye Onyemaechi. Layered in the soundtrack are 100 subliminal messages of positive self-affirmation, a first for computer gaming. The messages are undetectable by the conscious mind, but comprehensible, at least in theory, by your subconscious. They range from the harmonious (\"I love the world and the world loves me\") to the downright scary (\"It's OK for me to have everything I want\"). </p>  <p>Frankly, after playing the game for several hours, I don't feel any more confident or joyous. In fact, there seem to be opposing forces within the game itself: while the music soothes your nerves, the increasing challenge of each level increases your stress. </p>  <p>Even so, Endorfun is a challenging, unique puzzle game that is pleasant to look at and listen to. On a technical note, this game seems to be rather temperamental when run under Windows 95, causing a random general protection fault. While I found many complaints about this problem on TWI's America Online forum, there were no public answers or patch files posted. Perhaps the tech support folks figured the game's subliminal messages are enough to keep players happy. In closing, let me state that I now have an uncontrollable urge to let you know that I am a beautiful and perfect spirit.</p>",

You'd be wrong. This is a racing game, pure and simple. The twist is that you can race through the various tracks using any one of four &#147;rad&#148; modes of transportation - mountain bike, street luge, roller blades or skateboard.</p>  <p>Hosted via video inserts by ESPN's pixieish (and pixelated) Susie Kolber, anything goes in Extreme Games, from jumping on your opponents to delivering a nasty barrage of kicks and punches. Gameplay is fast and occasionally funny (watch out for chickens in South America), and driving music, spectacular crashes and a variety of competitors all combine to heighten the thrill. A tad of strategy comes into play when picking your vehicle before each race, and a season option allows you to amass points and purchase ever more advanced racing equipment. </p>  <p>If you're easily bored, you might find that the relatively limited number of tracks (there are only six) to be problem, especially since the split-screen two-player mode that proved so popular on the PlayStation version was omitted from the PC-CD, taking much of the game's replayability along with it. The controls will prove a headache for everyone. Each move (there are eight in all: right kick, left kick, right punch, left punch, jump, skate, brake, duck, turn left and turn right) requires its own command, and that's an awful lot keep track of at high speeds, even with an eight-button controller (try using Sony's recommended keyboard/joypad combination, and you'll feel like Mavis Beacon by the end of the first race).

            "body": "<p>S.S.I. has a long history of producing excellent RPGs and wargames, but their latest title in the Five-Star Series, Fantasy General, is a strange hybrid that combines the most unsavory elements of both. Backed by some sharp, if lifeless, visuals and a soundtrack that's designed to keep &#145;em rockin' in the cathedrals with out-of-place pipe-organ and sopranic arias, Fantasy General seems aimed at a bizarre and very unlikely audience.</p>  <p>Fantasy General is little more than Panzer General in a new box with some Dungeons and Drag... err&#133; fantasy units in place of the tanks (I could almost hear the game's producer ordering his art director, &#147;Quick, paint some fangs on that infantryman!&#148;). The story is almost as original, painting the timeless tale of a beautiful land held captive by a powerful, shadowy overlord (so shadowy, in fact, he's called the Shadowlord). After choosing one of four different leaders&#151;a knight, a barbarian, a wizard, or a sorceress&#151;you head to the hexagon-celled map in an all-out battle to the finish. Before each conflict, you're given a chance to purchase units from a list that your scientists give you. Next, you use the map to select the battle you wish to enter, pushing ever closer to the enemy's headquarters. Incongruously, no matter how much land you gain, if you fail in even one battle, the Shadowlord's minions overrun the entire planet. To put it mildly, this can be frustrating. The rest of the game follows standard wargame policy, and your turns are matched by those of the computer or a human opponent. If you fight hard and conquer an entire continent, you'll be treated to a disappointing single image of your character standing still.</p>  <p>In the end, Fantasy General is a game without an audience. Wargamers will find it abhorrently unrealistic, even for a fantasy title, and RPG fans will realize that its poor plot and character development don't make up for the hours spent watching small tiles run into each other. Recommended only for die-hard wargamers who don't care about realism, and for those who want to listen to funeral home tunes for hours on end.</p>",

            "body": "<p>To say that FIFA Soccer &#145;96 is the best-ever soccer simulation for the PC is like saying that Sergei Bubka is the greatest pole-vaulter in history. They're both very good, but there's really nothing out there to measure them against. Soccer sims have never been a big deal in the American market, and FIFA's only real competition comes from &#147;football&#148; products that are rarely available outside of Europe, and thus not an option for most U.S. players. But don't think FIFA Soccer '96 gets its good score by default. Quite the contrary; FIFA Soccer '96 is one of the most enjoyable PC sports titles available. Although the kick-and-run style may grate on the most self-important soccer enthusiasts, you still have enough control to put together some fairly complex goal-scoring plays. EA's Virtual Stadium graphic technology works well, providing a convincing feeling of being right in the stadium on game day. Cheering crowds (with different chants depending on your opponent), realistic weather and pitch, and the hilarious play-by-play of renowned soccer commentator John Motson (&#147;What a cheeky little play!&#148;) combine to give you an adrenaline-pumping, &#147;in-the-heart-of-the-action&#148; gaming sensation. EA brags about the player animations, and deservedly so; they really are quite incredible. You can easily execute jumping headers, bicycle kicks and other moves you've only dreamed of before. And there are plenty of venues to showcase these skills. The 300 teams from around the world have their own discernible strengths and weaknesses, and they can be arranged into custom leagues or World Cup tourneys for some intense international matchups.</p>  <p>Even with the league features, FIFA Soccer '96 might ultimately be viewed as too simplistic for real soccer strategy junkies, who'd probably prefer a text-based player management simulation anyway. But as John Motson might say, for the rest of us, it's one cheeky little game.</p>",

            "body": "<p>If you are a hard core video football fan in search of a PC pigskin program, look no further than Football Pro '96. This is the latest in a long line of football titles from Sierra Online, and although it isn't perfect, Football Pro '96 is arguably the best football game available for the PC. The number of options is staggering: the game lets you set up leagues, peruse statistics in all important (and some unimportant) categories, minutely adjust your coaching strategies, even change your team's uniform colors&#151;and that's just in exhibition mode. In full season mode, trades, injuries, and player management all come into play, and that's before you even step onto the field. If a season's not enough for you, you can play an entire career, where you have to reckon with free agency, serious injuries and player retirements.</p>  <p>Between the lines, Football Pro '96 stacks up well against against any PC football sim out there. The players are on the smallish side, but the SVGA graphics keep things so clear that you can even distinguish running lanes up the middle of the field&#151;a rarity in any football simulation, computer or console. The action is fairly realistic, although defenses tend  to tackle your ballcarriers from suspiciously long distances. As you might expect, the play calling (and play designing) features take a while to master, but there are three complexity levels to choose from, so you can learn at your own pace. Calling the plays is, of course, quite distinct from executing them--let's just say it takes a while before you can really apply the hurt to anybody.</p>  <p>If Football Pro '96 has a major flaw, it's that it bears too close a resemblance to its immediate predecessor. Even with its new graphics engine, it's a questionable purchase for those who already own Football Pro '95. Let's hope that Sierra has plans for a total revamp this coming season; in PC games, those who stand still inevitably fall behind.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Featuring a superb story that borrows from the cult films Easy Rider and Mad Max, Full Throttle is arguably LucasArts' finest graphic adventure creation. While the graphics are only slightly better than they were in Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road and Day of the Tentacle (the company's latest additions to this category), Full Throttle does feature 3-D rendered objects on its familiar jagged and blocky screens.</p>  <p>The engaging, film-quality script unfolds with the confidence and grace of its square-jawed main character, Ben. All the ingredients of a great story are here: murder, deception, greed, lust, unrequited love, honor, and of course, motorcycles. Surprisingly, despite all these elements, the plot doesn't ever seem forced or melodramatic; it just flows. Even in the face of adversity, Ben's gravel-voiced one-liners supply laugh-out-loud comedy that Schwarzenegger and Van Damme would envy. And while the game easily could have depicted biker gangs as a motley group of violent, remorseless criminals, it presents a clan of honorable loners who talk tough but don't hurt anyone without a really good reason. </p>  <p>Fitting into this tidy world of cause and effect are the game's logical, challenging puzzles. No great leaps in puzzle design were made from LucasArts' earlier adventure products, which usually involved finding and using specific items in the right place at the right time. Still, these puzzles are well-integrated, drawing you into the tale, rather than making you step back from the character and the story.</p>  <p>Although Full Throttle is as close to a perfect graphic adventure game as I've seen, it still has a few flaws. One section, where you drive your hog through a canyon and join an action-packed beat-em-up fest involving other biker gangs, uses a scaled-down version of the Rebel Assault game technology. Even with unlimited tries, an action sequence that requires twitch reflexes and mouse-eye coordination seems out of place in an adventure game that otherwise relies on your wits. </p>  <p>The second flaw, inherited from the company's earlier games, is the hunt-and-click problem. In a number of locations, the secret to discovering a hot-spot on the screen lies in clicking around aimlessly until you discover an unmarked hot-spot. Rather than measuring your deductive reasoning skills, this tactic tests your patience for mashing the mouse button. </p>  <p>Although many gamers have criticized this title as being too short, Full Throttle's amusing story and well-developed characters make this shortcoming easy to overlook. I am eagerly awaiting a sequel.</p>",

Just as Battle Arena Toshinden has done on the consoles, FX Fighter illustrates just how visually impressive a full 3-D environment can be. Even so, as with all ground-breaking technology, certain wrinkles need to be ironed out before FX Fighter can live up to its claim as the &#147;ultimate PC fighting game.&#148;</p>  <p>This is an extremely atmospheric and versatile title, allowing variation in environment, challenge, number of players, and graphic detail. The characters are diverse, both in appearance and ability, and the worlds where the battles take place are dark and surrealistic. While the characters are advertised to have forty different attacks, you rarely utilize (or need to utilize) more than about ten. In fact, if you get too ambitious, you risk sending your character spinning out of the ring and into the Great Beyond. </p>  <p>In order to develop the 3-D graphics and keep game speed at a respectable level, the designers kept the number of polygons as small as possible. The result is that the characters have a slightly wobbly, disjointed, almost drunken appearance. This actually helps the atmosphere, though, and makes sudden attack moves all the more exciting.</p>  <p>FX Fighter's final drawback is in the lack of challenge of the one-player mode.Only eight opponents are available, and, with minimal practice, you'll find a move that enables you to finish all of them with relative ease. Variable difficulty levels help, but you really need a friend to beat up on to extend the play value.</p>  <p>In general, FX Fighter's amazing graphics and personality see to it that this title is far and away the most inventive and interesting fighting game available for the PC today. With a bit of fine-tuning in response time and graphics, the result should be a game for the ages: FX Fighter 2.</p>",

This is a complete, detailed simulation of what it takes to get a car on the track every week, and make money doing it. Therefore, if you're looking for flat-out racing action, stop right here. If you like sims, though, and are interested in fine-tuning your rear spoiler, stealing technology from your competitors, and negotiating 15-year spare parts contracts, you will love this game.</p>  <p>All of this may sound a little confusing, but it's really not too bad. Advice windows are available throughout the game to help you make the tough (but actually random) decisions, and the format is very clear and straightforward. Sometimes you aren't told exactly why you should make the moves they recommend, but if you think carefully and move patiently you can quickly reach a minor level of success. In order to win a championship, though, nothing less than total immersion will suffice.</p>  <p>From a multimedia standpoint GPM is not going to blow anybody's socks off. The screens are clear and colorful, but almost uniformly static. The actual race screen lets you watch the cars circling the track, but only looking down from far above. Sound is confined to a repeated race car scream, with some background music thrown in. Sound and graphics are secondary, though; this game is about getting you hooked on the business of Grand Prix racing, and making sure you enjoy the ride.</p>",

Only Norman's signature course is included with the game, but it's quite enjoyable, and good-looking to boot (if you have enough memory&#151;see below). </p>  <p>Ultimate Championship Golf plays a lot like other golf games, with one major exception: you can adjust some 44 player characteristics before teeing off, from how you hit over water to how you hit out of a divot hole. You can also determine which type of player you want to be &#151;streaky or steady, accurate or long, etc. Unfortunately, when you play in the arcade mode, timing clicks of the mouse to actually execute the shot, none of these characteristics comes into play. If you screw up the timing, you'll take a mulligan regardless. It's only when you play in simulation mode, where you simply aim the shot and the computer hits it, that yoursettingss have an impact. It's ironic (but oddly necessary) that your selected control characteristics are significant factors only when you have little to no control over the actual shot. The game's other unusual feature is its rich, photo-realistic graphics engine. To fully enjoy it, though, you need two things: a lot of time (the painfully slow screen redraws will put you in the two hour range for 18 holes), and 19MB of RAM. It's possible to lower the graphics settings, though, so you can play a round with Greg without having to purchase a memory upgrade.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Okay, Deep Space Nine is rather a slow, dragging show, but a game based in that world could have been cool. Someday one probably will be&#151;but this isn't it. Players take the role of an envoy whose shuttle hard-lands at DS9 after being attacked by rogue drones of unknown origin. Your stay at the station ultimately involves the murder of an ambassador;  I won't spoil the ending by giving away any major plot points. Harbinger is a very good-looking, terrific-sounding, high-gloss parade of missed opportunities. The method of navigation, like the one used in Buried in Time,  is counter-intuitive. Your brain really starts to bend when you try perimiter navigation, which takes you not forward or backward but sort ofaround things. Never mind. To make matters worse, however, DS9 is not fully navigable, and with this level of graphic detail, you'll instinctively want to go exploring.  Of course, even if you could, there's no map.  Asking a computer for directions to an area and getting instead a rote, vague description of what that area is can give you a headache. The characters&#151;just as emotionless as they are on TV&#151;are computer-modeled bodies with textures mapped onto them, which you'd think would make them more realistic and human. Not so; with their bulbous heads, unblinking eyes and undersea movements, they actually seem  surreal and sort of spooky.  </p>  <p>Some pluses: this photorealistic game keeps you awake with some pretty tricky arcade sequences; you don't have to wait long before somebody sticks a phaser in your hand; and time spent at Quark's bar has certain rewardingly illicit undertones.  As a logical extension of the show, Harbinger hits the nail on the head:  it's low-key, very pretty, and ultimately kinda boring.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The Hardball series has always divided sports game buffs into two camps. Are you a stats freak, desperate for absolute accuracy and faithful statistical representation of all players? Or are you an arcade/action type, more interested in jacking towering homers, making diving catches and stealing multiple bases?</p>  <p>If you are the latter, I'm sure you've been looking forward to Hardball 5. Hardball titles have long been known for beautiful graphics and fast, exciting gameplay. In this respect, Hardball 5 does not disappoint. This baseball game is as colorful, easy to use, high-scoring and fast-paced as you will find this side of a Sony Playstation.</p>  <p>In previous iterations, all this fun came at the expense of statistical tracking and realism. Hardball 5 addresses both issues. The game generates piles of statistics, broken down by league, team, or position&#151;enough to satiate all but the hardest of hardcore stat lovers. (If you think you need more stats, you really need to get out more.) In addition, Accolade has added even greater manager-level control over your team. You can easily adjust your team's onfield characteristics&#151;tell &#145;em to run, hit for average, or swing for the fences&#151;without having to get your hands dirty and do anything yourself.</p>  <p>The on-field graphics in Hardball 5 are nothing to write home about. In fact, fielding in the outfield can get a little tricky from time to time in large part because of them. It's the actual pitcher/batter interface screen, though, that is this title's crown jewel. Great perspective, huge players and, most importantly, a huge strike zone make the process of hitting the ball a terrific blend of challenge and viewpoint. Once you get used to having the pitch coming right at you (not as difficult as many people think), you're prepared to tackle the most playable baseball sim on the shelves today.</p>",

First, a lot more of the fighting--at least for non-mage characters--is close-in, and involves devices such as maces, axes, hammers and other notoriously undainty implements of personal violence. Second, the sounds resulting from the employment of said implements are a lot nastier. (Wetter, if I must be perfectly clear on this point.)  The ability to choose between heroes of slightly differing abilities (strength, armor and magic, for instance) ultimately adds to the replay value of the game, and gives more of an edge to Death Match games. Respawning foes make life a bit more hectic, especially when you're going back looking for something you missed or failed to understand the first time.  You'll be doing a lot of that--the game levels are designed in &#147;hubs&#148; of environment through which you find yourself re-circulating, rather than in the linear \"level\" scheme of Doom.  Nice visual touches like swirling leaves, scattering bats, and non-critical ambient animations make the dark, 3-D fantasy locales more compelling and realistic&#151;even if you're still wandering around mystical ruins and slaughtering murderous grunting things.  Accessible audio track selection controls allow the carnage to take place to the game's adequate soundtrack or to the noise of your choice.  Slicker, smarter and more stylish than Doom---with all the killing and three times the replay value.",

            "body": "<p>In an era where graphics and sound development are pushed to the limit, New World Computing is still working on what counts the most, good gameplay. Although it may not be the most technically advanced game of the year, the company's latest spin-off, Heroes of Might and Magic, is an extremely enjoyable strategy game with a fantasy overtone that RPG fans will also appreciate.</p>  <p>Not much for storyline, Heroes invites you to jump straight into the action by choosing one of four different player types, Knight, Barbarian, Sorceress, or Warlock, each with their own specific powers and followers. Depending on the scenario, which can range from short games played out on a small map to extremely expansive adventures, you will have a goal that you must achieve to win the game. You start in your castle with at least one hero and will immediately need to build units appropriate to your starting character's background and the structures currently available to you. Building new edifices will enable you to recruit more powerful unit types, ranging from the relatively innocuous (goblins, sprites, and peasants) to the ultra-powerful (paladins, dragons, and phoenix). As you might expect, neither construction nor recruiting is free, and so you must take your army abroad in search of treasure, resources, and conquest.</p>  <p>Once on the main map, you'll immediate notice several small icons representing various encounters in your immediate area. As you explore these mini-adventures, you'll battle with wild monsters, discover magic spells, gain possession of valuable mercury and sulfur mines, and perhaps even find a few allies. For each valuable resource center you gain control of, from sawmills to gold mines, you'll gain a weekly allowance of that particular commodity. Your enemies will also want to gain control of these centers, so it's important to keep your troops on the ready at all times.</p>  <p>Game combat is very simple, and with a few exceptions, generally breaks down into who has the most and more powerful troops. In addition to the hand-to-hand and missile combat of the ground troops, you may utilize spell-casting. The game features over 25 different spells to choose from, ranging from exploration spells that help you find new resources to combat spells that will send fiery death raining down upon your opponents.</p>  <p>Heroes of Might and Magic isn't spectacular, but it sure is fun. The Multiplayer mode includes options for up to 4 players taking turns on one machine, or two player head-to-head competitions by network or modem connection. If you like turn-based strategy games, or you're an RPG fan looking for something a little different, you'll find that title is a worthy addition to your game library.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The starfighter genre has been around since Star Raiders debuted on the Atari 800, and few significant improvements have been made since. The same basic game design is retread again and again, and even high profile titles like Wing Commander IV offer little more in the way of gameplay than their predecessors. With Absolute Zero, Domark seems intent on taking a completely different approach to the genre. The problem is that while Absolute Zero's design concepts are unique, the game interface is poorly executed.</p>  <p>The story is well-conceived and fresh, following the lives of 24th century humans who have finally mastered cold fusion, and buzz around the solar system like busy bees. Much of the activity centers on Europa, an ice-covered Jovian moon that now provides fuel for human fusion engines. While they're mining, the busy little workers discover, under the Europan ice, a hibernating race of aliens&#151;who are now seriously pissed. Military reinforcements are a ways off, so the miners convert their equipment into makeshift military hardware to battle the aliens until help arrives.</p>  <p>It's not easy to jump into this game. The main interface, called a VR Tunnel, leaves you a bit unsure of what to do unless you've carefully read the manual first. Even so, with practice, you'll master the controls, piloting both air- and landcraft from the perspective of several different would-be heroes. As you progress through the game, more is revealed about your newfound foes and their strange crystalline forms.</p>  <p>Absolute Zero has some annoying drawbacks. Although the game installed smoothly under Windows 95, it took some work to get into the game setup to choose sound cards and other customizable options. This said, if you've got the patience to stick with it, Absolute Zero is a nice change of pace from the increasingly ordinary world of starfighting games. But, those looking to jump in and start shooting are headed for a frosty disappointment.</p>",

            "body": "<p>As side-scrolling shooter games go, there hasn't been much innovation since, say, the old coin-op game Elevator Action.  Sure, there've been a few crazy characters with quirky attributes like Mario, Sonic, and Earthworm Jim. And maybe there've been some minor additions: upgradeable weapons, hidden one-ups, incredibly mean bosses, and bonus levels. Then there's the technological advances such as parallax scrolling (if I had a dime for every time I've heard the phrase, \"Our game has more layers of scrolling backgrounds than &#133;\" I'd be a very rich man). But in terms of actual play, not much has changed in the side-scrolling, jumping and bumping, shooting and ducking, horizontal platform-game genre. Until now.</p>  <p>In one swift stroke, Crack dot Com's debut game, Abuse, has changed side-scrolling platform shooters forever, and all because of this game's superior control. The genre's main shortcoming has always been that your character must fire in the direction that you are traveling. Abuse solves this problem by allowing your character to shoot independently of the direction you happen to be pointing or traveling. Instead of using the keyboard for directional shooting, the game uses the mouse's smooth moving action to position a set of cross-hairs anywhere on the screen, saving the arrow keys for movement alone. This innovation  lets your character run and jump wildly about the screen, while staying calmly focused on a target. The game's level design re-creates Doom's anticipation, astonishment, and challenge, without ever seeming derivative. Everywhere you explore you'll encounter the eerie animal noises of frightening, mutated beasts who are waiting to leap out at you from dark corridors. You'll also hear sophisticated explosion sounds, including a hauntingly detailed rattle as your exploded target's pieces scatter across the floor. Often you'll find yourself in desperate situations that seem too tough to conquer, but a little regrouping, strategic planning, and mucho bravado will get you through&#151;just in time for the next, equally difficult barrier. Without its unique control, Abuse would still be a solidly-built shooter, with smooth animation, excellent sound design, and some interesting weapons. But, with its unique mouse and keyboard interface, Abuse stands alone as an amazingly innovative game, and one not to be missed.</p>",

The game doesn't waste any time: five minutes into gameplay, the player is confronted with a violation of Federation space, a group of alien defectors requesting political asylum, and a very large and pissed-off Romulan pursuit ship. For me, part of A Final Unity's appeal may be because I'm so used to computer games' bad voice-acting and HORRIBLE dialogue. Next to that stuff, this title's decent writing and Patrick Stewart's thespian baritone seem like the last batch of Sno-Cones in Hell. (In fact, the voice talent of the entire cast is here.) Further, almost every aspect of the game&#151;save-screens, astrogation, tactical combat, even the design of the manual&#151;is presented in a very attractive, straight-faced style consistent with what I shall call Star Fleet Aesthetics. Players less interested in starship operations and more excited by living the lives of their favorite Star Trek characters may &#145;delegate' technical operations such as combat and power routing to crew members if they wish, but the hard-core, armchair starship commander can take full control&#151;a very nice arrangement.  In fact, if the game has a notable flaw, it may be that options are sometimes a little too open, and the player's range of choices a little too broad. (But of course if we game reviewers didn't bitch about something, nobody would read our stuff.) Overall, this game offers an excellent extension of the feel of the show, and a solid game design as well.",

As one of four dukes of Karanthia, the game's fictional setting, you must crush your opponents in order to become the supreme emperor.</p>  <p>Although the plot sounds interesting, this title's dedication to mediocrity dooms it to failure. The graphics are lackluster and plain, and unless you're playing the game in SVGA mode, they're blocky as well. Sound effects are average at best&#151;although the soundtrack, which unfortunately plays only during screen selections, is one of the game's strongest points. The radio chat option, which allows you to hear what the other pilots are saying, is entertaining for a few minutes, but quickly loses its appeal when you realize that the same comments are being repeated over and over.</p>  <p>Flight dynamics are awkward and sluggish. No matter how long you practice, your plane continues to rock from side to side. As you fight the controls, enemy planes are busy circling your craft, occasionally letting loose bursts of machine gun fire. It's no fun being someone else's target practice. This aircraft shimmy comes back into play as you try to take aim on ground targets with your rockets. Imagine trying to play darts while standing on a jackhammer and you'll have a pretty good idea of what I'm getting at.Air Power may be the first ever airship combat game, but it's not the first good game idea to be applied badly. In the final analysis, the game is nothing more than an another title waiting for its turn in the bargain bin.</p>",

            "body": "Whether you're a serious armchair pilot or an arcade maniac who likes to blow the hell out of anything and everything in existence, Apache is the game for you.  This helicopter combat simulation throws you in the cockpit of the Apache attack chopper and lets you duke it out in four different theaters: Fort Hood, Cyprus, Yemen, or Korea.  In Fort Hood, you will learn the basics of helicopter combat.  The other areas are full combat arenas where your training will pay off. In Apache, you can choose to fly single missions or opt for a full campaign in any of the three combat regions. A variety of mission types&#151;ranging from escort to search and destroy sorties&#151;can be flown in varied weather conditions and at different times, even at night. Apache looks great throughout, featuring graphics that accurately portray the surroundings without ever sacrificing system speed.  Apache's gameplay is enhanced by a switch that allows players to toggle between a realistic flight model and an arcade mode.  This feature lets gamers who want the thrill of low altitude destruction to jump into the cockpit and, within minutes, start filling the skies with hot lead and missiles.  The realistic flight mode gives serious pilots the accuracy they crave, and is based in part on the flight experience of actual helicopter pilots. Other treats included in the game are an amazing multi-player option (up to 16 players can duke it out simultaneously), brilliant sound effects, and gorgeous external views. Apache does have a few flaws: loading times between screens are too long; and the minimum installation occupies over 25 megabytes of hard drive space. These minor problems, however, are hardly worth complaining about in light of the overall quality of Apache, one of the finest helicopter simulations ever made.",

Despite that superlative assessment, though, Bad Day is not for everyone. </p>  <p>In Bad Day you enter a dark, decrepit amusement park. As you encounter its bizarre inhabitants, a tragic tale begins to unfold. Your goal is to discover all the macabre details behind what turns out to be a complex story involving taxes, deceit, a serial killer, and red rat plague. Unfortunately, once you unravel this mystery, you probably will not come away feeling good about your accomplishment. Your goal in Bad Day is like your motivation for reading an engaging novel: to experience it, not solve it.</p>  <p>You begin your Bad Day as Timmy, an innocent young lad drawn to the run down amusement park near his home. As the wide-eyed youth wanders the dreary midway, he greets and gets to know its denizens. By assuming their personas, he crawls even deeper into this cesspool of life. Each character has a fascinating and tragic life story that they reveal to you as you move farther into the day. The more you learn, the more you empathize, and the more you understand why they interact the way they do. </p>  <p>There are virtually no adventure or role-playing game elements to Bad Day. You do need to discover a few \"secret\" locations and complete some tasks before more events will unfold, but playing Bad Day is basically like picking up a superbly illustrated book and flipping through the chapters. To complete the game means experiencing several Bad Days. It is impossible to learn the entire story in only one play-through: a built-in random element guarantees that as you begin each day anew, all actions and encounters change, as well as the ending.</p>  <p>Bad Day is a product of the fertile imaginations of The Residents, the anonymous performance artists whose first twisted CD-ROM offering, Freak Show, demonstrated an enticing potential for the medium. With Bad Day, they've come even closer to what may be the next genre of entertainment: interactive graphic novels. With graphics that perfectly match the story's mood, hauntingly upbeat music, and superbly crafted characters, the twisted design team has forged a story that is engrossing and entertaining throughout.</p>",

            "body": "<p>This is the best interactive, live-action video adventure game to date. Everything about it is first rate. The script weaves werewolf mythology and Bavarian history with sexual intrigue and businessmen's quests for their primal roots. The puzzles and problems are challenging and cleverly integrated into the plot, and there is an ever-present sense of danger and anxiety. This is well-executed, visceral, mentally exhausting, and exciting entertainment.</p>  <p>You control two characters operating in concurrent and parallel courses. Gabriel Knight is the seemingly less-than-bright but smart-as-a-fox mystery writer and bookstore owner; Grace Nakimura is his less-than-trusting assistant. Knight has inherited a castle and the title of Schattenjaeger (a German word invented by the game's writer, which means shadow hunter) that comes with it. Local villagers implore him to investigate the mysterious death of a little girl &#151;caused, they believe, by a werewolf. Knight and Nakimura's search for clues takes them to Munich, King Ludwig's famous Neuschwanstein castle and Bavaria's forested countryside. They encounter real-life drama, problem solving and detective work. </p>  <p>In crafting this title, author Jane Jensen did some serious investigating and research of her own. Her knowledge and love of things Bavarian comes through brilliantly as the game's climax approaches. Knight and Nakimura's efforts lead them to uncover the \"truth\" about King Ludwig's mysterious death, discover the \"lost\" Wagner opera, and come face-to-face with a werewolf in the maze-like cellar of the opera house.</p>  <p>The scope of this game is immense, ranging from the multitude of photo-realistic locations and superb actors, to the excellent Wagnerian music and operatic performances. This is what interactive entertainment is all about. The first Gabriel Knight adventure suffered from tedious clue-gathering and arduous gameplay but enjoyed reasonable popularity nevertheless. This second installment is light years beyond the first and should be on every adventurer's PC.</p>",

In fact, the crudely-drawn stylized artwork of the television series is accurately reproduced on the jagged lines of a computer screen. To complete the effect, Viacom New Media borrowed the original voice talent from the series, which creates a very smooth transition from linear to interactive, and in the process one very funny game.</p>  <p>All you'd expect from the eternally juvenile duo is here: fart jokes, painfully obvious sexual innuendoes, glorification of anything illegal or immoral, and the fruitless pursuit of girlfriends with one-liners such as, \"Hey, um, do you like to do, like, stuff?\" As with the show, the writers' satirical genius puts these antics into a perspective that makes everything undeniably funny.</p>  <p>You appropriately control the two half-wits with a simple set of commands, using a mouse-driven interface that looks and operates suspiciously like a LucasArts adventure game. </p>  <p>In fact, Virtual Stupidity is largely unoriginal in its approach to interactive adventures, and even some of the puzzles are secondhand fare. But that's just not the point here. What makes this game so entertaining (and I gleefully played it through to the end) are the actions and reactions of the intelligence-challenged duo to the people and objects around them. Imagine the two as they interrogate  patients on a mentally-deranged ward at the local jail. Or picture the look on Beavis' face as he inflates his shorts with a gas station air hose. Priceless.</p>  <p>Some adventure games test your cunning, your skill, and your MacGyver-like aptitude in building a flare gun from toothpicks and oily cloth. Virtual Stupidity does none of the above, but instead thrives as a refreshing, contemporary, relaxing exercise in moronic humor.</p>",

            "body": "<p>It's immediately obvious that Readysoft, the game's designers, were involved in the translation of the PC versions of the 1980's coin-op favorites, Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. In these games, and in Brain Dead 13, an animated sequence is played and you have a fraction of a second to press one of the arrow keys or the spacebar. If you guess correctly which key to press, the video sequence continues to play until you're given the next unforgiving chance to \"interact.\" If you don't, it's certain death and you start all over again. In the end, this means that the game must be played systematically as a process of elimination; in any given situation, you must press each key until you find the correct one. We're not talking real-time interaction here.  Just point Mr. One-finger at an arrow key, then sit back and watch the results. </p>  <p>The game has other flaws besides its grossly outdated gameplay. For instance, a number of rooms in the castle (see company line for plot overview) are mirror images of places you've been before. You can avoid the Red Witch, say, by pressing up, right, space bar, right, and so on. But to avoid the Green Witch, you'll press up, left, space bar, left, and so on. Even worse, it's never quite clear what the results of your actions will be. In one room you can escape through a door in the upper-left corner by pressing up, but another room with an exit in the same place will require you to press left to get out. This inconsistency and thoughtlessness in design highlights the problems inherent in imposing an interactive interface on a traditionally linear media.</p>  <p>Brain Dead 13 does have one positive aspect: the animated cartoon that provides the framework for your limited interaction. Full of colorful characters (both literally and figuratively), the clips feature incredibly smooth animation all neatly packed onto one CD-ROM. Although this level of production quality is no minor technical feat, it's not enough to save this game from being inducted into my own personal computer game Hall of Shame. Unless you're a fan of the Dragon's Lair series of games, I strongly suggest that you avoid this exercise in absolute frustration.</p>",

The only way to clear your good name is to once again muck about in time, both past and future. The biggest new gizmo in the new Journeyman is \"Arthur,\" a neural-net artificial intelligence chip which acts as gameplay advisor, educational commentator (this is one of the few games I've seen in years that's managed to slip in a little historical by-the-way without actively annoying me) and wisecracking sidekick. Arthur's advice runs simultaneously with commands executed in exploration mode&#151;and not as a separate function&#151;so this virtual pal truly is useful rather than irritating. Players can elicit comments from Arthur which may or may not be of value, and if the player's clue factor erodes completely, he or she can cave in and ask for \"help.&#148; If you're a lazy gamer, don't even bother with &#147;Adventure&#148; mode&#151;you'll just hurt yourself.

            "body": "\"Buy low, sell high\": it's not only a way of life in America, it describes a whole category of game known as the \"economic sim\".  Pioneered by Railroad Tycoon and popularized by Impressions (Air Buck, Detroit, High Seas Trader), this game type appeals only to a certain type of person: one who prefers to conquer with bucks, not bullets.  And the most elaborate and impressive example of this genre seen yet is Capitalism, created by Hong Kong native Trevor Chan.  It is obsessively detailed, painfully complex, and very realistic.      The goal of Capitalism is sweeping: turn your corporation into the most profitable one in the world.  There are so many ways to do this that we can only touch on a few of them here.  You start up a company with a set amount of capital and cut-throat competition, and go forth into the marketplace by choosing an area on the map to start your operation.  With a massive variety of screens and options, you can choose to farm, mine, mass-produce, import/export, retail, manufacture, or research.  This is the guts of the game, where you decide which way your company is going to go by sizing up the different regions and their resources.       For example, if cotton comes in at the only port and you have the ability to manufacture shirts, you can start as a clothes manufacturer.  You set up buildings and links to buy the cotton (or even farm it), research the process, and make the shirts.  Then you find a city and set up a retail store, actually hiring inventory, sales, and advertising staff, deciding how to improve product recognition through advertising, and completing dozens of complex tasks to make your shirts take over the marketplace.    And that's just one aspect of this game.  You can then go into other retail trades, create department stores, build farms and sell off the produce, and generally go hog-wild trying to increase profits.  I cannot even begin to hint at the density and complexity of this game.  Put it this way: if you want to sell milk, you have to build farms, raise cattle, process the cattle, ship milk to the factory, get raw material for glass, make the glass, bottle the milk, research ways to improve the milk, and then ship it off to the stores.  Fortunately, you can hire a C.E.O. once your company is established, freeing you up to go off and start another company, which greatly cuts down on micromanagement.     Complex stock options, takeovers, and other features make Capitalism an often dizzying experience.  Choose from a few dozen scenarios with set requirements for victory, or try a free-form play in which pure conquest in a certain region is the goal. Getting into the swing of things is made easier by an eight-part tutorial that walks you through each aspect of the game, but this game is still for only the most dedicated economic sim fans.",

            "body": "<p>After the disappointing example set by X-COM 2, many gamers expected Civilization II to be nothing more than Sid Meier's original game with a few new graphics tacked on. Others were worried that the game's designers would stray too far from the path, and would ruin the spectacular play balance that made Civilization such a hit. In the end, the design team at Microprose managed to add a score of new play elements that help the aging strategy classic evolve - without sacrificing the game's addictive qualities.</p>  <p>Although players familiar with the original Civilization will probably be able to jump in and start playing right away, a swarm of new features definitely warrants a few minutes with the manual. What players will most likely notice first is the much greater number of races to choose from, including the Sioux, the Carthaginians, and the Chinese, as well as a customizing option that lets you create any personal favorites the designers may have missed. This time around, cultural variations are  also represented onscreen by four different city growth patterns. The fantastic number of new combat units adds limitless possibilities, as players figure out new ways to use marines (who can attack from the sea), cruise missiles, paratroopers, and even religious fanatics to their best advantage. For those who grew tired of the chaotic battlegrounds of the original game (remember when that chariot took out your battleship?), there's a new warfare system that gives units a score in both firepower and hit points for more realistic combat results. All of these features combine to give the game a powerful depth, and enough variation to ensure that players will be loading this one up for months to come.</p>  <p>Plenty of little details in Civilization II are also worth noting: an improved graphics set featuring a three-quarters viewpoint similar to Syndicate or Crusader, entertaining sound effects that range from the trumpet of an elephant to the air raid sirens of an atomic attack, full-motion video clips for each of the civilization advances, and a full map editor that enables players to design their own fields of conquest. Although the game suffers from its lack of multiplayer options, there's really nothing available that can compete with its depth of play, subtlety of challenge, and pure addictive potential. The fact is, if you're a strategy fan, you've already bought this game, and if you're not, this title could turn you around.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Execution and details are 90 percent of what makes a good game great.  When your Command &amp; Conquer commando sprite unexpectedly shouts, \"Got a present for ya!\" before slapping a wad of C-4 to a SAM site, well, it kinda gives you a warm fuzzy feeling all over. Starting from the load-screens and straight on 'til morning, Command &amp; Conquer is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen. Focusing on the global conflict between the fictional Global Defense Initiative (read \"NATO with a budget problem\") and Brotherhood of Nod (read \"Illuminati meets Warsaw Pact\") organizations, Command &amp; Conquer puts the player in complete charge of fast-paced, squad-level military operations utilizing a wide variety of troops, ground vehicles, base installations, air strikes, and production facilities. </p>  <p>Throwing in just enough full-motion video to build the proper mindset between scenarios, C&amp;C's main hook is its battlefield action: real-time, command-based, and  simultaneous. Thus, you may send a squad of grenadiers to take out an enemy airfield to stop the influx of reinforcements, and suddenly realize that as you've been doing this, bazookamen have started bashing your one production facility. Of course rerouting a group of tanks to deal with the bazooka menace turns out to be exactly what the enemy wanted you to do, and as 20 minigunners close on your undefended HQ, you anxiously count the seconds to the next friendly air strike that'll make everything nice again. The tension produced by so many multiple layers of real-time interaction is what computer gamers live for, and a number of different high-energy soundtracks keep adrenaline levels maxed out. Playing the entire conflict in the role of the other side makes for twice the gameplay value, and I don't even want to think about what's going to happen when the six-player networkable version comes out.  Highly, highly recommended.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Most historical simulations share a common problem:  their developers, after devoting hours and hours to detailed period research, don't seem to have enough  time left over to create decent game frameworks that use the information properly. The end result? Many gamers think historical sims are boring or dry&#151;when, in fact, if combined with solid gameplay, these games can provide unparalleled realism for adventure and strategy fans. In their latest release, Conquest of the New World, Interplay has managed to combine top-notch graphics, sound, and gameplay with a detailed historical framework to create a title that is both addictive and entertaining from start to finish.</p>  <p>Gamers will first notice Conquest's incredible landscape graphics. In the standard strategy tradition, players move their various pieces (including explorers, colonists, and soldiers) through a blacked-out world, uncovering beautiful mountains, plains, and rivers. The first player to discover any landmark gets to name it.  After mapping out some of the local terrain, the next step is to build a colony and make it self-sufficient. To this end, players can build sawmills, metal mines, housing, and farms to generate the resources and space necessary to expand, and eventually, to build more colonies. Then comes the hard part: convincing the natives and other countries of the world that you are a force to be reckoned with.</p>  <p>As with any good strategy game, combat is an inevitability in Conquest of the New World, and Interplay has done an excellent job here as well. Combat takes place on a simple three-by-four grid; each competing combatant controls three different unit types (infantry, cavalry, and artillery) and attacks other forces with varying success, depending on the skill of the army's leaders. This abstract warfare system works extremely well, offering players a chance to affect the outcome of their battles through tactical skill, while keeping each individual conflict relatively short (most battles take between three and six minutes).</p>  <p>Thanks to its outstanding features&#151;the naming of geographic markers (nothing is as satisfying as mountains and rivers named after gastrointestinal disorders), historical atmosphere, customizable play (you can align yourself with a nationality that matches your particular style), and network options (up to six players can compete)&#151;Conquest of the World manages to take an interesting era and make it into a fantastic strategy game.</p>",

            "body": "<p>It's a rare treat when a game is so viscerally exciting that its shortcomings can be overlooked. Such is the case with Crusader: No Remorse, a hyper-violent shooter from Origin Systems. Forget the cheesy full motion video scenes and the obligatory bad acting. Forget the sometimes frustrating controls which can send your character jumping across the screen without warning. In Crusader, only one thing is important: Things blow up real good. </p>  <p>The game is set in a cartoon-like, Orwellian future. Individual rights are nonexistent, and every aspect of daily life has come under the control of the World Economic Consortium. As a defector from the WEC's elite Silencer force, you have lent your skills to the resistance movement. The tone is set by the excellent packaging materials, which recall the halcyon days of the late, great Infocom. Included is a Consortium handbook with scrawled notes from your resistance comrades and a hilarious newsletter showing everyday living in this brave new world, both of which give depth to the otherwise search-and-destroy nature of the game.</p>  <p>Avoiding the ubiquitous first-person perspective, Crusader utilizes a three-quarter overhead view, similar to Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure or later entries in the Ultima series. From this vantage point, you go through a series of lengthy missions, mostly just excuses to destroy everything in sight. And destroy everything you will, once you take a gander at the glorious SVGA graphics. The attention to destructive detail is mind-boggling. Shoot a Consortium chump in the back and he will buckle appropriately, a pool of blood slowly forming beneath him. Shoot virtually any piece of scenery and it will explode, igniting any unlucky bystanders who will run around screaming until they collapse in a heap of ashes. The game may be amoral as all get-out, but it sure is fun. </p>  <p>Don't be surprised to find that Crusader is far from perfect. The quirky controls and somewhat disappointing plot sequences can be distracting, and the missions are something less than a mental workout. Even so, if you're the kind of player who enjoys laying waste to an enemy compound, Crusader's glass-shattering ferocity is tailor-made for you.</p>",

            "body": "<p>At first glance you might dismiss CyberMage: Darklight Awakening as just another Doom clone. But Origin, the other big boys in Texas, have used the canvas of a Doom-like first-person 3-D engine to paint a master work of their own in this comic-book action game. </p>  <p>The interface expands greatly on the Doom model. The three dimensional world lets you crouch, as well as look up and down, skills that will enable you to find cleverly hidden items and give you proper perspective as you make perilous leaps across dangerously high platforms. Like Doom, CyberMage also pits you against hordes of enemies who come from every direction, but power-ups and new weapons are harder to come by than in most 3-D games, requiring you to think strategically and use both your conventional and magical weapons sparingly. Restocking can be tricky, as you must find standard ammunition to reload your conventional armament, and rest occasionally to replenish the drain of your magical weapons on your superpower.</p>  <p>On-screen readouts keep you abreast of your ammo supplies, health, magical power, and armor strength. You'll often find that there's too much information on the screen at once, but you can toggle through different views so that only the most important gauges are left on the screen.</p>  <p>CyberMage's two most notable improvements over most Doom clones are its ability to enter and operate vehicles, and the development of story through other characters' digitized speech. The vehicle modes are very simple, and the game designers wisely keep the action moving by not introducing a complicated set of keys for vehicle operation. Key characters in each level approach you and give you information or orders that advance the plot. Thanks to excellent sound design, these speech passages are surprisingly realistic&#151;if you turn while someone is speaking to you the voice will be louder from the left or right speaker respectively.</p>  <p>CyberMage's comic-book story tie-in is a little hard to swallow because of the conflict between the blocky nature of 3-D games and the colorful art that is the hallmark of comics. Even so, CyberMage remains a triumphant example of successfully applied creativity in an existing game genre.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The Dark Eye is without a doubt one of the most original computer games ever created. Missing are all attempts to re-create interfaces or settings from earlier games, which, in the end, both harms and benefits the overall game. In its attempt to redefine the computer entertainment experience, The Dark Eye never adequately explains the on-screen action as it skips from one point of view to another, and from story to story. This schizophrenic behavior begins in the introductory sequence, an artfully constructed series of visual montages with a bizarre voice-over that is literally hard to understand and continues throughout the game's winding story. In its own weird way, the sequence sets the scene for your arrival at a mansion, The Dark Eye's launching pad into the numerous interactive Poe stories housed within.</p>  <p>As you roam through the house, you are approached by a number of eerily animated stop-motion puppets who address you and divulge information about people and situations that never seem to have significance in the game. Little attempt is made to help you understand exactly who you are, how your character relates to the others, or even what your final goal is. Through a series of stumblings and aimless clickings, I found myself in the role of another character, in a different time and place, and immediately encountered yet another set of confusing people, conversations and circumstances. The skimpy manual supplied only a few clues to my goals in the game, and even fewer on how to attain them. </p>  <p>Behind this chaotic content lie some of the most incredible graphics and artistic offerings I've ever seen in this medium. The animated characters are painstakingly seamed into ornately dilapidated 3-D computer rendered environments, creating an effect that must be seen to be believed. Also included, and just as beautiful, are graphic novel versions of Poe classics with grating readings by Mr. Burroughs. If you have the patience to complete the trying steps required to reach these gems, you'll be duly rewarded, but if you're the kind of person who doesn't enjoy or understand impressionist films, then The Dark Eye isn't for you.</p>",

More imitative than innovative, most of these clones have long since been forgotten. Thankfully, LucasArts' Dark Forces has not suffered the same fate. One of the first titles to actually improve upon the Doom formula, Dark Forces managed to rise above &#147;me-too&#148; status and become a great game in its own right.</p>  <p>The story is straight to the point: the Empire has commissioned a new type of Stormtrooper, known as &#147;Dark Troopers.&#148; These devastating killing machines are being developed in several remote bases. As Kyle Katarn - a former Imperial Officer who has joined the Rebellion - you must investigate each exotic locale, searching for evidence and employing sabotage techniques to thwart the Empire's devious plan. Along the way you'll face an entire cast of familiar foes, including Stormtroopers, Imperial Guards, Boba Fett, and even Jaba the Hutt.</p>  <p>Using an enhanced engine that allows jumping and crawling, Dark Forces is more than just another 3D kill-fest. The levels are diverse and ingenious, with plenty of creative obstacles standing between you and your goal. These obstacles range from simple puzzles that open new areas, to arcade-like action tests that require you to jump along rocky crags and make your way across moving conveyor belts. While they can be occasionally frustrating, Dark Forces' diverse gameplay requirements make this title more mentally challenging than your average key hunt.</p>  <p>Of course, it doesn't hurt that the game is set in the Star Wars universe. It's much more fun to blast Imperial lackeys than faceless monsters. The familiar setting is enhanced by your enemies' taunts, like &#147;Stop, Rebel Scum!&#148; Dark Forces' only real flaws are its tragically short length - less than a dozen levels - and its lack of multiplayer options or add-ons, which severely limits the replay value.</p>",

Descent II  expands upon the original's x-y-z axis combat with 30 new levels (culminating in a battle inside the enemy mother ship), a scout recon robot which comes back for you if you fall behind, a suitably loud and grinding soundtrack (by Ogre of Skinny Puppy, with Redbook Audio, no less), a particularly irritating \"thief-bot\" enemy that hunts you down and drains your energy, and a new AI scheme which Interplay assures me will adapt to my style of playing (although I still seem to be able to fool it with decidedly Germanic dogfight tactics&#151;he who hath ears, let him hear).

No exploding body parts or fireball-vomiting demons here--Descent puts an industrial spin on the genre by taking you into the bowels of huge factory-like space stations to fight mining robots gone mad.</p>  <p>Consider this: in space, there is no up or down. Descent uses that concept to hit you like a 9G turn with a labyrinth environment and free range of motion on the x-, y-, and z-axes. Nudge your spaceship into a room, and watch out&#151;attacks can come from your left or right, from above or below you. You'll spin your ship around while firing missiles and lasers until vertigo isn't just an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but a way of life. Surrounded by this chaos you must rescue scattered human hostages and gather powerups  while trying to keep your firepower and shields at their max. A 3-D rotating map is available for those who can't handle the bewildering turns of each level.</p>  <p>With addictive action, network multi-player play and Descent level editors available everywhere you turn, I say without hyperbole that Descent is destined to be a classic. Don't believe me? Download the widely available free demos (while you're at it, check out Descent II as well) and judge for yourself. Just remember to keep your airsickness bag handy.</p>",

The beautifully-rendered racetracks have their moments, but the real focus here is &#147;The Bowl,&#148; an open arena holding a dozen cars, all turned loose on each other. Though the cars may look realistic as they are reduced to smoking, lumbering junk, automotive physics has been cheerfully chucked out the driver's side window in the name of smoother gameplay. Cars are confined to a 2-D plane, unable to roll or even get two wheels off the ground&#151;but don't worry, you won't be disappointed after inflicting your first full-tilt-boogie 360&deg; on another car.

If you like viciously violent, anti-story entertainment (Seagal, anyone?) you'll slaver at the chance to slay new monsters with perfectly robust hardware. Those seeking the ultimate in home demon protection can now protect their plane of existence with a double-barreled, pump-action, combat shotgun that blasts more holes than Mobil Oil.</p>  <p>Among the new monsters included, Mancubus and Arch-Vile rank at the top of the &#147;hope there's nothing behind this door&#148; list. Mancubus is a big droning brute of a cement mixer who hurls balls of fire. Arch-Vile, the ragged edge of a dead man's nightmare, conjures up an evil flame of death and revives dead enemies.</p>  <p>Even with its darkly entertaining firepower and pleasingly grotesque menagerie, the game has its flaws, like an unrelenting and simplistic soundtrack that gets pretty annoying over time. (Don't worry, though, the game's sound effects are as brilliant as they were in the original, and remain one of its best features.) More bothersome, especially for fans of the first game, is that the repetitious action in this nasty and brutish sequel just isn't as addictive as it was in the original hit. Doom II doesn't build the same visceral or emotional connection because it doesn't enhance the original experience in any original way. Compared to Hexen, for example, which broadens the Heretic legend, Doom II adds little substance and no plot to its predecessor (space marine saves earth by killing monsters isn't a plot).</p>  <p>Doom II is a dark, disturbing game. And while it may not bring anything new to the genre, it can create obsession-level loyalty if you tend not to look beyond the barrel of a gun.</p>",

The venerable masters of the CRPG realm, Sir-Tech, have deviated from their usual path with a title that is far from the statistic-heavy titles of the Wizardry series. Druid walks the line between RPG (character development, stats, combat, and magic) and adventure (story driven, simple point-and-click interface) admirably, offering benefits of each genre to the overall package.  While this may turn off some veteran gamers, Druid, even with its little quirks, is a fun game, and more accessible to new players than many of its RPG competitors.</p>  <p>Sir-Tech have taken great pains to research druidic lore, and that attention to detail is obvious throughout the game's nature-oriented play. Interacting with the world around you is easy&#151;you can mouse-click your way through almost everything&#151;but unfortunate problems with the inventory system make the interface far from perfect.</p>  <p>The story unfolds nicely, against the game's backdrop of intricately rendered backgrounds.  The hero in Druid is rendered in detail, and is viewed during play from a three-quarters view similar to that of Origin's Ultima VIII. The dedication to visuals pays off, and the game is almost as much fun to watch as it is to play.  Druid is a rich experience, even with its failings, and perhaps more importantly, it's accessible to the veteran and the novice alike&#151;a broad appeal the entire RPG genre lacks.</p>",

            "body": "<p>It's rare when a game comes along that really kicks your ass. 3D Realm's full version of Duke Nukem 3D is just that kind of posterior pummeler. With its free-flowing 3D action, over-the-top weapons, and ruthlessly attitudinal protagonist, Duke Nukem will have PC gamers worldwide rubbing their rumps with spine-tingling glee. Prepare to take off your thinking cap and immerse yourself in a world of violent bliss. The ballots have been cast and the verdict has arrived: The Duke is A-#1.</p>  <p>Based on the hackneyed first-person Doom formula, Duke Nukem 3D is the first 3D shoot-em-up to offer the player more. There are more diverse environments, more devastating weapons, and greatly improved playability. Unlike the fantastical dungeons and lava pits found in Doom and its kindred, the atmosphere in Duke Nukem is more tangible. The story revolves loosely around a \"Mars needs women\" theme, involving aliens and their abduction of scantily-clad women. As Duke, you explore everything from an alien mothership to metropolitan underbellies, including smut shops, skin flicks, strip bars, and the horror of horrors: karaoke bars. The levels are massive and, even on the easiest difficulty setting, provide a formidable challenge. </p>  <p>Duke allows you to be an action hero to the tenth power. If it moves, shoot it. If it doesn't move, shoot it. Anything and everything can be destroyed. Coin stuck in the soda machine? Pipe bomb the sucker. Toilet won't flush? Nothing a few rounds from your doubled-barreled shotgun can't handle. You slay your way through each scenario, filling aliens full of lead, even shooting wounded adversaries as they bleed on the ground, whimpering for mercy. And all the while, Duke punctuates the violence with the type of flippantly cool asides required of our modern-day action heroes: \"It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I'm all outta gum.\"</p>  <p>Sure Duke's a brazenly tough chartacter, but as the saying goes, \"the weapon makes the man.\" 3D Realms has saved the most destructive weapons for the registered release. In addition to the standard issue firearms found in the shareware version, you now have access to the Freezer (transforms your opponent into a fragile block of ice), the Shrinker (reduces your opponent to bite-size proportions), the Tripbomb (great for creating booby traps), and the Devastator (the name says it all).</p>  <p>There were, however, a few morally questionable conventions of the game - namely those numerous instances in which the player comes across one or several women, bound and rendered helpless by the aliens, who are almost always inadvertently caught in the line of fire. Aside from that, Duke Nukem 3D is one of the best action games to be released in a long, long time. Dozens of games have tried to snatch the Doom crown, but Duke may be the first contender to get a clean shot at the throne. And as Duke himself would say, \"Hail to the King, baby.\"</p>",

You're broke, dirty and on the lam from The Kid, one tough hombre, all because of a poker game turned ugly.</p>  <p>Credit CyberFlix, known for their futuristic shoot-'em-ups, not only for departing from what's been successful, but for delivering an engaging, if not the most challenging, adventure game.  Dust has the requisite items for you to find and store for later use, and people for you to talk to in order to gain useful information, but this standard fare is given new and sometimes humorous twists. An apple pie, for instance, can be traded for a pair of boots or used to kill one of Diamondback's more unsavory elements.</p>  <p>Most puzzles have several solutions, each of which leads you down a different path to your ultimate rendezvous with destiny.  The entire town has a very fluid look and feel, including citizens who go about their business as you go about yours, and cinematics that help advance key story points.</p>  <p>You'll interact with more than 30 different characters as you attempt to rid yourself of The Kid, solve the mystery of a lost Spanish silver mine, and save this destitute town from itself.  One aspect of this game that leaves plenty of room for improvement is the acting.  Maybe they were meant to be colorful or amusing, but most of the characters are simply annoying and you will likely find yourself irked by almost all of them at some point.</p>  <p>Overall, Dust is a far better-than-average game and is an especially good introduction to the adventure genre.  While this title is not terribly taxing at the outset, even seasoned gamers will have to leap a few hurdles before happily riding off into the sunset.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The 7th Guest was one of the biggest selling CD-ROM games ever made, and many cite it as a major reason for the explosion in CD-ROM drive sales around the time of its release. That was almost three years ago; reported sales results of The 11th Hour suggest that history will not repeat itself.</p>  <p>After spending two-and-a-half years in development, Trilobyte has released a game that is somehow dated and innovative at the same time. It seems dated because its puzzles are only beautiful, 3-D renderings of puzzles that have been around since time began.  Moreover, the game's overall structure and objective make it nearly identical to its predecessor. The 11th Hour is innovative, though, because it includes loads of well-produced video clips that make up the game's storyline - and also because that video plays so fast at full-screen that it could be mistaken for television or movie-speed images.</p>  <p>Not surprisingly, these conflicting aspects of the game go together  like oil and water. The only way the game designers could think to link these disparate parts was by creating an out-of-place sci-fi prop: a personal digital assistant, called the gamebook, that plays events back in full-color video. As you move deeper into the game, the gamebook's role becomes increasingly undefined,  as it also serves as a communication device for Stauf, Ms. Morales, and an unknown entity who provides clues to help you solve puzzles if you can't figure them out by yourself.</p>  <p>Even apart from this inconsistency, Trilobyte still fails to deliver on its promise of \"broadening the interactive entertainment market by creating and delivering original, high quality products with mass-market appeal.\" The 11th Hour does not broaden the market; in the end, it looks and feels like any of a number of games that have borrowed from the 7th Guest formula. And as far as mass-market appeal, it's unlikely that more than a handful of gamers will have the patience to sit through the game's glacial movement from point to point and its equally slow plot progression, much less figure out its overly difficult logic puzzles that seem to have little or no relation to the story.</p>  <p>On the technical side, The 11th Hour often requires a lot of dancing around inside your PC to pull off the game's high video frame-rate at full screen. In my case, I spent some time with Virgin's adept tech support staff to get the game running smoothly.</p>  <p>Without meaning to, The 11th Hour has taught the gaming industry a few valuable lessons:  First, the sequel isn't always as successful as the original. Second, pretty graphics and cool video sequences do not ensure a good overall gaming experience. Third, and perhaps most importantly, game creators should stay true to their claims, or they'll disappoint their audience in the end. </p>",

            "body": "<p>3D Lemmings is a unique puzzle game where you decide the ultimate fate of dozens of foolish, furry-footed rodents. As lemmings tend to walk in a straight line, even if it means certain death, you must assign them such positions as turners, blockers, and diggers as they traverse dangerous levels containing trampolines, springs, and rope slides.</p>  <p>The graphics in 3D Lemmings are colorful and eye pleasing. The lemmings are adorable, even while screaming in terror as they fall into the ocean and drown. And, as the name implies, 3D Lemmings is a truly 3-D game where you can move and view the action on any axis. </p>  <p>The game sound is inconsistent. Although the classical soundtrack playing on some levels is very soothing and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, the hard-edged music in other stages can be quite nerve-wracking. Fortunately, the sound effects, particularly the voices of the lemmings, are humorous and cute, especially when all the lemmings shout \"Armageddon\" in their high-pitched, Chipmunkesque voices. Controls can be a bit tricky and confusing in the beginning, but 3D Lemmings provides a practice mode where you can try out all of the moves before jumping into the actual game. In no time, you'll be directing those little critters with great speed and efficiency. Another nice feature of 3D Lemmings is its \"Auto Replay.\" This option will replay your last set of moves until you wish to take control. This is particularly handy for tricky parts of a puzzle that require quick mouse and keyboard combinations.</p>  <p>With addictive gameplay, numerous levels, and cute little rodents, 3D Lemmings is a must-buy for anyone looking for a unique and incredibly fun gaming experience. Many hours of sleep will be lost as you try to conquer just one more level. Now if only I can figure out how to get the lemmings to mow my yard&#133;.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Bullfrog Entertainment's Magic Carpet was one of the best, most inventive games to be released in the last few years. An excellent mix of action and strategy, Magic Carpet was unfairly lumped into the 3-D shooter genre despite the game's highly cranial plot, puzzles, and controls. Magic Carpet II: Netherworlds hasn't deviated far from the original formula, but it contains a slew of new aesthetic and gameplay features which provide more focus and improve on an already stunning atmosphere. As in the original, players fly around on the eponymous rug, fighting creatures and other wizards using an arsenal of spells. The structure of the game, however, has been drastically revamped. In Magic Carpet, the player's only goal was to fly around the world collecting &#147;mana,&#148; a magical element released when the creatures of the land were destroyed. Once enough mana had been gathered, the player could proceed to the next level. Magic Carpet II eliminates the redundancy of this single-goal scenario, and relies on objective-based levels instead. These objectives range from the simple&#151;say, flying to a particular point&#151;to the challenging, where you are called upon to destroy an entire race of creatures.</p>  <p>And there are plenty of new creatures to destroy, as well as new spells to destroy them with. Even better, Magic Carpet II's new experienced-based system makes spells gain effectiveness as players become more proficient. The flight engine and the graphics have also been improved, speeding up the action and making it better -looking. In addition, sinister nocturnal and claustrophobic underground missions are included, delivering much more visual and strategic diversity.</p>  <p>With Magic Carpet II, Bullfrog has both maintained the spirit of a classic and improved on it in almost every respect. This title is an excellent successor to Magic Carpet and guarantees plenty of frequent flyer miles for every would-be wizard.</p>",

The first was a port to Windows 95 and the NetMech bundle, and a MechWarrior 2, Part 2 is also in the works.  But fans who can't get enough will find the new mechs and missions of the first expansion pack an essential buy. </p>  <p>Ghost Bear's Legacy is a good addition to the MechWarrior 2 family, although it could have been a bit better.  Installation is cumbersome, requiring a disk check against your original MW2 disk.  Then, it doesn't add GBL to your old Mech install, but creates an entirely new, stand-alone game that chews up about 30 megs and must be run from its own directory. More irritating still, it's DOS only and, since it deals with a new clan, you have to start as a new cadet. Simply adding some new missions to the old game would have been just fine, thank you very much. </p>  <p>Beyond this, however, GBL is a fine production with a slick new intro and some new cutscenes.  The first mission helps set your difficulty level by having you fight a seemingly endless stream of opponents: however many you take out before going down determines how tough the following missions will be.  After this, you're sent on about a dozen missions, linked by a story that revolves around the retrieval of the clan's stolen genetic heritage.        </p>  <p>These missions are tough and innovative, and include information gathering and some deep penetrations in which you'll need to use the same mech for several battles in a row.  Activision has even tried their hand at making an underwater battle, which comes off feeling like regular Mech, only bluer.  A similar fate befalls the \"forest\" scenarios, with trees that look more like telephone poles.  Some new mechs, such as the Kodiak, Incubus, and Linebacker, help spice up the mix, as do killer new weapons like the anti-missile system, inferno missiles, torpedoes, and others.       </p>  <p>Ghost Bear Legacy is a good package, not a great one.  There are only twelve missions, and gamers would have benefited greatly from a mission editor.  Still, it proves there's some kick left in the old Mech 2, and if you finished the original missions you'll probably want to check it out.</p>",

As a new pilot for either side, you must bring your clan victories and do so with honor in order to ensure success and rise through the ranks.  </p>  <p>Different battles have different goals: sometimes search and destroy, sometimes recon, base strikes, or other missions.  As your playing improves, you're put at the head of a squad which you control. In each mission you can outfit yourselfwith a custom Mech, which you can modify down to weapons loadout, heat sinks, engine, and so forth.  Over a dozen Mechs are available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and picking the right one for the job at hand can becrucial.</p>  <p>The graphics are gorgeous, with display resolution running from 320x200 to 1024x768 HiRes SVGA.  At the highest detail levels (which even top-notch Pentiums will have trouble with) you can see right down to the clan insignia on the side of the enemy Mechs.  Even in 640x480, the view through the cockpit of your Mech is stunning. </p>  <p>A new version also runs native in Windows 95, and includes the NetMech bundle, allowing for head-to-head games over LAN and direct connection.  (NetMech is available separately for DOS gamers.)  The Win95 version doesn't seem to run quite as smoothly, and I had a bear of a time getting a stable connection for NetMech.  Once up and running, however, you can play with \"team\" games such as capture the flag, \"steal the plans,\" and scavenger hunt, as well as last-mech-standing duels in cities, canyons and other locations.</p>  <p>This is no cake walk: MechWarrior 2 is a tough, demanding game, with challenging controls and opponents. Maneuvering both the Mech and the turret can be a tricky proposition at times. With controls more like those of a flight sim, and a need for strategy and planning, this is not your average action game.  It demands a lot of computer systems and gamers alike, but it delivers like nothing else around.</p>",

            "body": "<p>MIT begat Zork, which begat Infocom, the king of text adventure games, which begat an ill-fated attempt at developing business software (!), which begat bankruptcy.  But Infocom also begat a small company called Legend Entertainment, devoted to making text-ish adventures for thinking people.  Legend mated point-and-click interfaces and graphics with well-written adventure prose for a meaty, old-fashioned computer game experience.  But Legend couldn't hold back the tide of graphic adventure games.  So, as if to show just how good they were as game designers, Legend cranked out Mission Critical, a science fiction adventure with heavy graphic flair, set in deep space and starring Patricia Charbonneau and Michael Dorn.</p>  <p>In the future, the United States and other nations are fighting another war of independence against a fascist United Nations-run world government.  Mission Critical provides the setup through a well-done video sequence; Michael Dorn plays the captain of the USS Lexington, defeated by a UN starship.  Feigning surrender, he ferries over his crew to the enemy craft&#150;-along with a nuclear warhead, sacrificing himself and his crew just to give you a chance to complete the Lexington's mission&#150;which you'll need to puzzle out from video logs and computer records.   </p>  <p>Put simply, Mission Critical was one of the best adventures of 1995.  The halls of a 22nd Century starship are rendered in 7th Guest-like detail, using camera-on-rails animation that delivers an illusion of smooth 3-D movement down hallways or into rooms. Pick up objects, open containers and solve puzzles&#151;all typical adventure fare, but Mission Critical gives you a great deal more. As your adventure moves from the immediate problem of repairing a badly-damaged spacecraft to fighting deep space battles to first contact with aliens, you'll unravel a greater cosmic mystery that could affect the entire human race. A chilling beginning and deep science-fiction premises make Mission Critical an adventure game to savor.</p>",

Attached to all game pieces, board locations and events are beautifully rendered 3-D animations&#151;over 800 in all&#151;that faithfully recreate the game's early 1930s appeal. The soundtrack is pleasant, though it can get annoying over the duration of what are often lengthy competitions. Besides the window dressing, Monopoly also offers everything you'd expect from the board game: money, extensive trading options that allow players to wheel and deal properties, and even \"Get Out of Jail Free\" cards.</p>  <p>Monopoly's greatest feature is its carefully designed multiplayer support.You can challenge up to five other players in either network or Internet mode. If none of your friends are ready to play, check out Westwood's Internet waiting room, where you'll find other players from all over the world who are looking for a game. (Yes, the game will even sort out differences in language and currency types.).</p>  <p>In the end, even with all the bells and whistles, Monopoly is Monopoly, and if you don't like the board game, you won't like the computer adaptation. But if you're a fan, Westwood's take on the venerable classic is a great way to compete with players all over the world from the comfort of your own home.</p>",

Microsoft Golf is a perfect example. Using the exact same game engine and add-on courses as the terrific Links series from Access, this game is fun, challenging and easy to get into. It does not, however, bring anything particularly new to the table.</p>  <p>The question is, then, do we want anything new? As certain members of the British royal family has recently proven, doing something new (adultery, phone sex and divorce) may not be the best way to endear oneself to the public. Taking that lesson to heart, Microsoft Golf's designers focused on the elements of a great golf game without going overboard on the bells and whistles.</p>  <p>And as far as golf games go, this is one of the best. From the smooth interface and fast redraws to catchy voiceovers, putting grids, fly-bys and tips, Microsoft Golf will see to it that your round of golf is enjoyable, immersive, and, perhaps most important, quick. One minor problem: it's next to impossible to develop consistency when chipping from around the greens - but most golf pros will tell you chipping is one of the hardest parts of the game.</p>  <p>Replays from normal and reverse angles let you decide whether to play a mulligan or save the replay for later viewing. (See - now you've got a way to prove all those golf stories you've been telling.) You can play against a friend or the computer, or log onto the PlayerNet for long distance modem battles. And for those who crave variety, Microsoft Golf is one of the few golf simulations that comes complete with two different courses, both of which are very good.</p>",

Reviewers, hard-pressed for adjectives, often describe new CDs as \"Myst-like.\" And you'll be hard-pressed to find any reviews that say a product has gone beyond Myst.</p>  <p>Myst is an immersive experience that draws you in and won't let you go. You enter a unique setting, venturing alone to varied times and places, the worlds that compose Myst. There are no instructions, and you encounter no living beings but soon realize your actions may help individuals who are somehow trapped in a parallel dimension.</p>  <p>You don't so much play Myst, as experience it. Of course you must solve a multitude of puzzles, mazes, and problems, but Myst's principal attractions are its environment and the underlying intrafamily drama that unfolds as you explore.</p>  <p>Unlike most adventure games, Myst offers no inventory, no death, and no dialogue. Although puzzles don't seem to have much direct connection to the game, they share a commonality. They take on many forms but follow a consistent thread. Some puzzles are very challenging, even obtuse, creating an odd paradox: many buy Myst, but few complete it. It is immensely popular, but most nonadventurers quit in frustration. Fortunately, Myst's popularity has spawned several online sites for hints, walk-throughs, and even saved games (see GameSpot's Myst-links).</p>  <p>While Myst is superlative, I do have two complaints: the lack of high-end 3D and animated visuals, and the cheesy ending. Almost all its animations are simple QuickTime videos running in tiny screens. Myst's creators, Rand and Robyn Miller, seamlessly integrated those videos into the background graphics and designed stunning artwork, but simply adding fog is not enough to create a true 3D feel. And the ending is a big let-down, not much more than a plug for Myst II. Nevertheless, if you own a PC, you owe it to yourself to try Myst.</p>",

            "body": "<p>How do you make a good thing better? This is the question Electronic Arts faced trying to follow up last year's smash hit, NBA Live &#145;95. Well, how about adding faithful renditions of all NBA courts? Or create-your-own custom teams? Or kicking bass beats that play during time-outs? Or tip-dunks? Or more fancy jams and passes? How about all of the above?</p>  <p>That's exactly what EA has done with NBA Live 96. Although they're not known for drastically changing their game engines (remember Lakers v. Celtics, Celtics v. Bulls, etc.?), the folks at EA have rebuilt NBA Live 96 from the ground up, using their much-ballyhooed Virtual Stadium technology. Despite some slight player pixelization, you will find this game plays more like real basketball than its predecessor&#151;or any other PC basketball sim, for that matter. It's easy, when you're on the court, running the break, with the crowd roaring, to feel&#151;dare I say it?&#151; &#147;in the game&#148;&#151;and that will keep most players coming back for more.</p>  <p>Besides the audiovisual enhancements, the biggest improvement to NBA Live 96 is that the refs no longer rule the game. Although too many defensive stands still end in fouls, you can turn the sensitivity up (eliminating the pushing, shoving Laimbeer-ball of NBA Live &#145;95) and still not spend the entire game watching your opponent shoot free throws. This creates a fast-paced, physical game with all the excitement, continuity and strategy of real NBA action. If you prefer a different style of play, you're in luck because everything&#151; from the rules to the fouls to the difficulty level&#151;is fully adjustable.</p>  <p>Add to this new function the stellar gameplay comprehensive stats, play diagrams, shot charts, trades, and player photos and comparisons (you can pick any two players and see how they stack up against each other in every conceivable way), and it's clear that EA has done this sequel right, making a good game much, much better.</p>",

And, if you're a die-hard bowler, it's probably all you hoped for. For the rest of us, though, PBA Bowling leaves a little to be desired.</p>  <p>Now, I'm as big a bowling fan as the next guy. My problem here is that translating bowling to a video game takes away most of the fun. Even real bowling would quickly lose its appeal if you could aim the ball perfectly every time, and this is precisely what happens in PBA Bowling. The game gives you four windows: one is your scorecard, one controls the spin and power, one sets where you aim your shot, and one shows the ball hitting the pins. These controls are straightforward and easy to use, but the truth is that a well-aimed, straight shot will almost always bring a good result, if not a strike. After a couple of games I was bowling in the high 200's, which doesn't leave a lot to shoot for.</p>  <p>As for the extras in the game, there aren't many. Being able to change the weight and color of the ball or your clothes is nice, but has no real impact on actual gameplay. Similarly, the game options (and there are only five), with the exception of the lane conditions, are purely environmental. The sound effects are perfunctory, and, while the graphics are nice, the actual ball-to-pin impact results in a kind of anti-gravity, slow-motion mass of floating pins, robbing you of the crash and explosion that all bowlers crave.</p>  <p>While not a total gutterball, PBA needs to address shortcomings in value and challenge if it wants to be the elusive perfect game.</p>",

A four-plus-million-dollar budget and over two years in production do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming.</p>  <p>Much of Phantasmagoria is spent on typical adventure activities: exploring, grabbing items, and problem solving. And on that level, the game is reasonably enjoyable. In addition, the graphics are excellent, the music is emotive, and there are many pleasant surprises. But problems arise in several areas: experienced adventurers will find Phantasmagoria generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame. For instance, during day one Adrienne discovers a secret chapel full of bizarre items yet doesn't think it important enough to tell her husband. On day two, she barely breaks a sweat over the fact that her hubby has transformed from a loving partner to a crazed lunatic. </p>  <p>Many of this title's problems come from complexities inherent in taking a huge concept and trying to wring a game out of it. Somebody forgot to do some detailed planning and fine-tuning. This is clear from the character interactions, the repetitive nature of some scenes, and the unrealistic puzzles--the telescope eyepiece \"glints\" in the sand only after you discover you need it, even though you've walked by that spot several times already.</p>  <p>So why is Phantasmagoria so darned popular? It's accessible to newbies, it's a new genre, and Sierra has promoted the hell out of it. The built-in hint system can turn this into a cakewalk and you'll be wowed by the occasional top notch production values. Unfortunately, the repetitive violence may turn the newcomers off just as quickly. My recommendation: Phantasmagoria is only for the gaming-challenged. Otherwise try Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within. It's Sierra's second big-time video adventure and they learned from their mistakes.</p>",

Police Quest: SWAT is not an adventure game, but an attempt to simulate the experience of being a Special Weapons and Tactics team member. Unfortunately, the designers, under the guidance of former LA Police Chief Daryl Gates, seem to have aimed for realism in all the wrong places.</p>  <p>Most of your game time is spent at the various SWAT training facilities, honing your marksmanship skills while waiting to be \"called up\" on assignment. For the most part, these training areas are no more than point-and-click shooting games, mighty boring and plenty repetitive. Even more frustrating is the fact that they do little to prepare you for actual assignments and are included only, it seems, to simulate the typical day of a SWAT member.</p>  <p>In the actual missions, any pretense of realism is discarded. With only a few commands and an inadequate communication system at your disposal, missions are more like restrictive puzzles than strategic simulations. The linear structure simply requires the player to execute a predetermined set of actions, but it is never quite clear what those actions are. When the mission is over, it's hard to tell whether it was completed correctly or not. Adding to this confusion, each scenario is repeated more than once, each time closing with a different outcome, but never with any justification for the inconsistencies.</p>  <p>On top of everything, SWAT is burdened by one of the most cumbersome interfaces ever devised. Figuring out what to do in this game is difficult enough, but the poor design makes figuring out how to do it nearly impossible.</p>  <p>SWAT begins with an interesting premise, but the designers seem to have paid too much attention to detail in the wrong areas. Humdrum tasks are too prevalent, and the areas which could have been truly intriguing are simply confusing and frustrating.</p>",

            "body": "<p>The interactive movie is still an undefined animal in its early evolutionary stages, based on a vague vision shared by filmmakers and game developers. The concept that the viewer can make choices that will instantaneously affect the outcome of a motion picture is compelling. However, even with new strides in compression technology, the computer isn't an ideal film or video-playback machine, just as the VCR and film projector aren't adequate as computing devices that keep track of your input and choose appropriate movie clips to string together. So for the time being, innovative projects like Psychic Detective are as close we get to the dream of a true interactive cinematic experience.</p>  <p>Together with noted animation and production house Colossal Pictures of MTV's Liquid Television and Aeon Flux fame, Electronic Arts has assembled a valiant but jumbled effort with this campy supernatural thriller. The whole movie-game is filmed from the first-person perspective, so be prepared for lots of jerky camera movements and in-your-face conversations. You can use your psychic powers to jump into the heads of other characters and see through their eyes, or you can keep your point of view and try to control others' minds by \"throwing\" mood suggestions such as aggression, affection, or submission. </p>  <p>At first glance, Psychic Detective appears to be a highly approachable game with film-like qualities that draw you into its rich storyline. Upon closer observation, though, the game plays like a number of miniature plot lines mashed together with no unifying thread. I found myself opting not to interact, just so I could attempt to have a congruous experience from one person's point of view. If you play the game the way you're intended to&#151;mind-hopping, psyche-reading, and emotion-throwing--it is a triple CD set of visual impressions that travels liberally through multiple perspectives, times, and settings resulting in a mysterious combination of clips that only a real detective could unravel. Even after playing the game all the way through a handful of times, I still couldn't tell you what 80% of the main plot was about.</p>  <p>Methinks that Hollywood has a very different idea of what an interactive movie should look and feel like. Psychic Detective has too many story branches and mind-hopping options for its own good. Instead of being like a good movie enhanced by interactivity, Psychic Detective is a more like a movie (I still couldn't tell you if it's a good one or not) clouded with interactive options that eventually detract from the project.</p>",

            "body": "<p>It's been a long time since the release of Westwood's Lands of Lore, but most gamers will recognize its obvious influence on the design of Anvil of Dawn, New World Computing's beginner-level RPG. Even so, originality isn't everything, and the company has done a commendable job of combining solid graphics and animation with the successful play style of Westwood's classic.</p>  <p>Players start the game by choosing one of five characters, each with their own special gifts in qualities including strength, agility, and magic use. Once their identity is sorted out, players will use the game's pleasingly simple first person, turn-based interface to move through Tempest, a war torn world that (as usual) requires a hero (or heroine&#151;and I  commend New World for their inclusion of two female player characters) to sort things out. As the game progresses, characters will face dozens of enemies, all of them unique, not the typical Tolkienesque denizens of most RPGs. Weapons range from commonplace items such as spears, bows, axes and swords to magical armament that enables players to stand up against some of the game's more powerful opponents. Twenty-five spells are also available in seven different disciplines (Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, Flesh, and Void) for characters wily enough to learn them. This title walks the line between the combat and puzzles genres very delicately, and most adventurers will find the game maintains an enjoyable balance throughout.</p>  <p>There's no doubt that Anvil of Dawn reformulates something that's been done before, but in the end, it's a pretty good rehash. The game's entertaining storyline, easy-to-understand statistics, and functional game balance earn it a place on any beginning RPG fan's shelf. On the flip side, those who are looking for an RPG with depth of play and characters that can be highly personalized will probably walk away from this title disappointed. </p>",

These puzzles mostly involve process of elimination and can be a bit tedious; success depends on equal parts of skill, luck, and patience (with a little knowledge of astrology thrown in). Your character, Laura, moves efficiently, if slowly, through the hospital, only pausing when there is an interactivity or something of note. This keeps the game from bogging down too deeply in the larger areas of the hospital, which is helpful because the game, with its two-hour time limit, is challenging enough as it is.</p>  <p>The real stars of D, though, are the graphics and sound. While Laura is not always quite as expressive as you might expect her to be (Hey, Laura, that's a huge boulder chasing you down the stairs! Why do you look like you're about to doze off?), the designers have plunged her into a dark, ominous world, full of eerie sounds, floating apparitions, and gruesome sights. I'll even admit to getting a little shiver now and then. </p>  <p>One warning: the story line is pretty macabre, and I'm certain a lot of mothers out there don't want their kids getting any ideas from this game. In general, though, if you can handle a little animated blood and some general weirdness, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and prepare to be wowed</p>",

            "body": "Intracorp's Chronomaster is a fantastic adventure game with one of the most innovative plots ever conceived. As Korda, the chronomaster, it is your job to find out who is putting the man-made universes into stasis. To do this you must visit each universe, find its specific world key, use it to reactivate the pocket universe, and find clues that lead you to the saboteur. Each pocket universe has its own laws of physics that you must come to understand if you're going to be effective, making your strange dimension-hopping a little more difficult in the long run. The only way for you to avoid the stasis effect and accomplish your goals is to use the most bizarre and wonderful of substances: bottled time. Once you've invoked its effects, you bring a small circle of animation to the otherwise static universe around you, creating some rather unusual visual effects. (Don't get close to anyone whose just fired a gun.) The plot uses all of these twisted time effects to their greatest advantage, making for a tale that is unlike any other ever conceived in a computer game.     Chronomaster is filled with incredibly beautiful scenes, and boasts music and sound effects strong enough to back them up. The voice acting is fairly good, but is often muffled enough to make understanding the details very difficult.     This is a very slow moving game that encourages you to explore everything. Puzzles are difficult, not the type you will most likely solve in one sitting. In the end, this is one for action fans to avoid; fans of Myst or other puzzle games will be most pleased.",

            "body": "<p>When Sid Meier's Civilization was first released, it seemed the perfect venue for multi-player gaming. At that time, though, on-line gaming was still in its infancy, and the idea of a networkable version of the title was put on the back burner for awhile. Now there's CivNet, a game that maintains the addictive qualities of the original, in a format that delivers the added challenge that comes only with human opponents. Unfortunately, hindered by tragically slow response speeds and overshadowed by the release of Civilization 2, the final form of the long-awaited CivNet is somewhat disappointing.</p>  <p>For all intents and purposes, the game is Civilization with a slick new Windows interface. As in the original, each player selects a culture and attempts to mold the populace&#151;through the development of science, the expansion of land holdings, and the improvement of the quality of city life&#151;into the most powerful civilization of all time. A few new features have been added, including a king builder that enables players to create a visual representation of their alter ego, and a map editor to allow the creation of personalized landscapes, but for the most part these changes are superficial and don't affect gameplay.</p>  <p>CivNet's multi-player link-up capability, which could have made the game more than just a nice enough Windows version of Civilization, is probably its weakest feature. Each of the two different modes of play has  specific disadvantages. If players select the turn-based play option, they are dooming themselves to a purgatory of 10-minute waits as each player takes a turn and the game updates. Simultaneous movement speeds up the whole process a bit, but adds the non-Civilization chance of enemy units attacking you in the middle of your turn. In a game with more than two human players, neither of these options is really acceptable, and gameplay can be pretty frustrating.</p>  <p>As a single- or two-player version of Civilization, CivNet is a solid play, but pales beneath the glory of Civilization 2. If Microprose had really wanted to grab the gamers, they should have spent a few more months figuring out how to speed up gameplay, and then incorporated the finished multi-player system into Civ 2. As it is, this game is only recommended for groups of two who want to test their skills in head-to-head competition.</p>",

            "body": "<p>If you've ever played 3DRealms' shareware favorite Terminal Velocity (TV), you'll be quick to recognize that Fury3 is nothing more than warmed-over TV, released as one of the first titles designed with Win95's 32-bit abilities in mind. So let me quickly get the brief comparison out of the way.</p>  <p>The big difference between Fury3 and Terminal Velocity is that Fury3 runs in Windows. Installation is much easier, and you are dealing with the familiar Windows interface. There are slight changes in the worlds, new Star Wars-type enemies, and varied cockpit perspectives but, in general, Fury3 is not any faster, more colorful or more exciting than Terminal Velocity. For those who have never played either of these titles, let me make clear that Fury3 is still fast, colorful, and exciting enough to ensure a white-knuckled, high-adrenaline, duckin-and-dodging-in-your-seat kind of gameplay experience. Note that slowdown will occur with 486/66 machines. The game features a first-person, 3-D point of view which puts you right in the middle of a futuristic battle zone, with nothing less than the future of the world at stake. The graphics are extremely impressive, giving you the sensation of speeding along just above the ground, weaving through tight, underground passageways, or soaring up through the cloud layer. Explosions and flying debris highlight the combat sequences. Power-ups and hidden passageways are all available to help you on your journey.</p>  <p>You're not going to get a lot of extended play value from Fury3. Despite the vastness of the worlds, which allows you to fly around and look for hidden tunnels and powerups, there is not enough variety from level to level, or even from enemy to enemy, to keep a hard-core shooter fan interested beyond the first couple of worlds. If you just need a quick fix of high-speed flying and blasting, though, Fury3 is a great way to pass some time.</p>",

Unfortunately, like so many games that seek to bridge genres, Top Gun ultimately disappoints both of its intended audiences. The problem lies in its gameplay:  too complex for the arcade fan, and too simplistic to pose a real challenge to experienced fighter jocks.</p>  <p>Spectrum seems to have forgotten that the one critical element of any arcade-style game is action. Even on the &#147;Arcade&#148; setting, Top Gun fails to deliver any sort of rewarding play. Dogfights are typically quick, long range missile engagements, followed by relatively long periods of uneventful flying.</p>  <p>On the other hand, the most critical element of a traditional flight simulation is realism. Once again, Top Gun fails to score a kill. The simplistic combat model is made even worse by the seemingly intentional disregard for realism found in the dialog. To be fair, though, the movie never attempted to be very realistic. This flaw was easily overlooked in the movie because the action, cinematography, and music were all first rate. Sadly, this is not the case with the game. </p>  <p>The graphics in Top Gun are as schizophrenic as the gameplay. In hi-res mode, the aircraft are rendered with detailed texture maps, giving them a nice, clean look on par with US Navy Fighters. Unfortunately, the terrain looks absolutely atrocious. Even in 640x480 resolution, the earth looks blocky and cluttered. Even worse, it is almost impossible to pick out any detail among the flickering brown and green globs (even airports are difficult to see until you are right on top of them.)  The cutscenes within the game are often marred by cheesy dialogue and mediocre acting, and even the theme song &#147;Dangerzone&#148; has been redubbed by an unknown artist.</p>  <p>In summary, Top Gun is a title that is sub-par in almost every aspect. It may be of interest to diehard fans of the movie, or as a &#147;training&#148; simulation for those intimidated by SU-27 or EF-2000.  Everyone else is advised to &#147;turn and burn&#148;.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Sierra has been perfecting their brand of computer adventure games for over fifteen years, and game designer Al Lowe has been a major part of that evolution. His ribald Softporn Adventure, re-made into Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, was religiously played by every teenager with access to a computer. In his latest project, Torin's Passage, Lowe has cast aside the bathroom humor and created a game suitable for adventurers both young and old.</p>  <p>The script tries to stray from Lowe's usual vulgar jokes, but still includes playfully overstated poo and hemorrhoid mentions. And while it's thankfully devoid of his usual sexist fare, you should be prepared for a lot of corny humor mixed in with a few clever lines.</p>  <p>Although Lowe maintained control of the writing and game design, he employed over forty specialized artists to create the game's visual artwork, music and sound effects, and it shows. Every scene in this adventure is beautifully crafted using a hybrid of hand-drawn cell animation, oil paint backgrounds, 3-D rendered objects, and the less fluid computer-generated art. While this may sound hodgepodge and gaudy, the overall effect is harmonious. Digital music, sound effects, and speech are flawless on a fast machine, but a major slowdown will occur below 75MHZ.  </p>  <p>The puzzles, and there are plenty, come in two varieties: contextual (place gum on stick, use stick to pick up coin from grate) and exploratory (push the red button and the bridge lowers halfway, the green one makes it raise halfway). In an interesting (and pleasing) development, Sierra included on-line hints for all of the game's puzzles. This means no more long-distance calls to a hint-line or frustrating weeks of being stuck in the same place, but wanting to continue the game. Veteran adventurers might weave their way through the game's difficult logic puzzles, but novices will definitely need to use the on-line hints. Though this game is aimed at a younger audience, it may be too difficult for all but gifted children. Even so, the storyline and characters should keep the young ones enthralled while older siblings or parents wrestle with the puzzles. A fine family play.</p>",

As a penniless music-video producer stranded in a bizarre alien dimension, your job is to videotape as many unearthly happenings as you can and, using your Personal Media Tower's built-in video/audio editing station, sell rock videos to the finicky producers back on Earth.  Yeah, okay, why not.  Central to this task is the creation of music videos custom-made for the personal preferences of each bonehead music-biz exec on the other end of the interdimensional videophone--which, short &#147;editing demo&#148; aside, proves to be a fairly involved task, requiring the splicing together of vast video and audio clip libraries, plus whatever alien footage the player has managed to procure.  The ultimate goal of the game is to return to Earth with wealth, fame, or a combination of the two, depending upon which path you choose--but the real point of Total Distortion is to wander about and have nonlinear fun, creating strange drinks and sandwiches from blocks of unsynthesized Food Goo, browsing a library of odd books (everything from slider-puzzles which may yield game clues to guided tours of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district), and enduring the MTV-flavored weirdness (the player's first of many possible deaths results in a &#147;video,&#148; cheerfully sung by his slayer, with lyrics like &#147;You are dead, you are so, so dead...&#148;). Very late-80's and too strange not to check out.  Have a few stiff drinks first.",

            "body": "<p>Tetris has remained the king of puzzle games, like an electronic Rubik's Cube among me-too Missing Link and Rubik's Revenge wanna-bes. But Tetris may have maintained its position unfairly, since many of its numerous knock-offs are not only more fun, but more ingenious as well.</p>  <p>Zoop falls into this category: a game obviously inspired by Alexey Pajitnov's falling blocks that involves much more pizzazz and strategy. Set in what might be the bottom of Tetris's vertical well, colorful shapes assault your triangular piece from all sides. As you zap them, you assume their color and they assume yours; if they're already your color, they disappear, but if they aren't, they keep coming and&#133; Well, it all sounds very complicated on paper but it's actually quite elegant when it's in motion.</p>  <p>The unique artwork in Zoop adds to the fun. The pastels and rounded shapes of the sprites reminded me of an Eisenhower-era cocktail party or some nouveau-riche box of Lucky Charms, with purple martini glasses, green olives, and orange berets. Backgrounds add to the confusion, with space-age bachelor-pad wallpaper patterns forcing your eyes to move away from the action and causing your blood pressure to skyrocket.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, one big obstacle prevents Zoop from becoming the ultimate Tetris-killer: the game is just too darn hard. It starts off at breakneck speed and never lets up, never giving the player an adequate chance to develop any strategy or interest. It's always over just as you're getting the hang of it. </p>  <p>Once you do break through the initial frustration, though, Zoop will gradually become an addiction. So throw on those Martin Denny records, pour yourself a sloe gin fizz, and get yourself hooked on this hip little game, daddy-o.</p>",

The cast of Take 2 Interactive's Ripper is studded with tarnished stars, and this most recent vehicle contributes to the oxidization process. </p>  <p>The game's most famous cast member, Christopher Walken, is inexcusably bad as Detective Vincent Magnotta&#151;a cop with a violent past and a personal connection to the Ripper. After Walken's convincing and powerful cinematic performances in movies such as The Deer Hunter and The Dead Zone, this largely amateurish portrayal makes you wonder what could have led to such a debacle. Did he know his lines before he stepped in front of the camera? Was the budget so tight that there was only one take of each scene?  Did the director misread the script as much as Walken did? Does Walken consider acting in an interactive project a small-time gig with an unimportant audience? These are only a few of the questions I'd like to ask the creators of this game.</p>  <p>The story is a familiar one (see The Company Line) for anyone who's seen a horror film in the last fifteen years, but the script itself is full of predictably awful dialogue that includes new and exciting uses of the F-word in any pivotal scene. The cast could be subject of a documentary entitled Low-budget Movie Stars of the '80s: Where Are They Now? The answer to this question would be, \"in possibly the most disappointing game of 1996.\" Booting the game brings forth another blast from the past in the form of Blue Oyster Cult's aging hit, \"Don't Fear The Reaper,\" which has no relation to the game except for the questionable word association between \"ripper\" and \"reaper.\" This type of illogical grouping serves as the basis for Ripper's puzzles, where reason is cast aside in favor of weak connections and quasi-logic. Instead of the story-based puzzles of a graphic adventure or Myst-like logic puzzles, Ripper opts for a mix of both with solutions so cryptic that the game offers no sense of continuity or logical story progression.</p>  <p>More noticeable still is the sloppy implementation and programming that presumably led to the callous release of this six-disc monstrosity. This casual approach shows through with countless incompatibilities and errors that make playing the game without a crash as much of an adventure as the game itself.</p>  <p>With all of this going against it, Ripper should be commended only for what it aimed to achieve, but failed to follow through on. This game is a weak hybrid experiment that combines the graphic adventure genre with a grand scale movie production&#151;and will hopefully send other developers scrambling to one-up Take 2 with better parts to create one playable, enjoyable whole. </p>",

Featuring SuperVGA graphics, excellent digitized sounds, and extensive replay value, Steel Panthers is your chance to recreate some of World War II's classic armor battles from the comfort of your own home. </p>  <p>Steel Panthers offers a wide range of choices from the moment you open the box.  You can choose to play specific scenarios, a longer campaign, or a randomly generated battle&#151;and if this still isn't enough, SSI has included the same game editorused to create combat scenarios in the game. This is not a title you'll be able to jump right into, and both the manual and myself strongly urge novice players to follow the tutorial until the game options become familiar.  Once you're started, though, it's very easy to get hooked.</p>  <p>The sounds of tanks exploding, machine guns chattering, and engines growling make this a far more engrossing experience than most other war games.  Steel Panthers also provides nice graphic touches, like burning tanks and drifting smoke, to enhance this compelling atmosphere.  Another benefit of this audiovisual experience is its power to distract you from some minor problems with the AI, the game's one noticeable flaw.  While the computer plays well, it often suffers from predictable behavior. But those who find the game too easy can always choose to play as the handicapped Polish or Italian armies.</p>  <p>SSI provides adequate documentation with the game, but not all of it is particularly useful or easy to find. (For instance, the README file provides invaluable charts and tables that should have been included in the manual.)  Steel Panthers also has some small bugs, but a patch is due out from SSI any day now. Despite these small problems, Steel Panthers remains a superlative example of its genre, and one that is dangerously addictive. </p>",
